            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is impoſſible (right honorable) for a man to turne himſelfe any kinde of way heere in this world, either in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to minde generally, the heauens and earth, either yet particulerly, the glorious garniſhing, light, brightnes, &amp; mouings of the one, and the great plentie of all ſortes of beaſts, foules, and fruits of the other, together with the infinite diuerſitie of flowres, wherewith God, by his heauenly wiſedome and goodneſſe, euery yeere afreſhe, meruellouſly clotheth, and repareth them, as it were with rich, and beautifull attyres and colours: But that hee, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten (I ſay) as hee beholdeth theſe ſo wonderful works of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, muſte euen ſo often needes confeſſe that there is ſet before his eyes, a moſt large matter &amp; argument for him, to glorifie thee altogether good, &amp; only omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t God, who hath not created all things for the vſe of man only, but alſo euen for his delight and pleaſure. For hee is ſo good and glorious a Father to all his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as that his very meaning is) ſo wee take them modeſtly and thankfully) to haue vs freely vſe his benefits for our neceſſitie, yea, and receiue them with pleaſure, and delight, without ſcruple of conſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For els, to what purpoſe ſhould we haue created ſuch a number of ſortes of fruites, differing in ſubſtance, ſtrength and nurriture, &amp; of ſo ſundry ſhapes, in greatnes thicknes, &amp; colour, in ſmel, taſt, &amp; ſauor, except it had bin both to ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ghte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; delight vs? For doth wine onely ſtrengthen our bodies? doth it not likewiſe, as Dauid reckoneth it amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the benefites of the Almighty, glad the heart of man. And therefore, what is hee that can bee ſo bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh, as not to thinke as much generally, of all the reſt of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
<pb facs="tcp:7663:3"/> of God, which he dayly beſtoweth vpon vs, for the ſuſtening of our bodies. Yet notwithſtanding, this were not enough for vs, hereupon to acknowledge, as our dutie is, the fatherly care which hee hath ouer our preſent life, in adminiſtring to vs whatſoeuer is needfull for the ſame: except wee eftſoones learned alſo heereby, that hee alone, who principally is the father of our ſoules, (for, it is hee that hath created and regenerated them) giueth the foode of euerlaſting life vnto them, by the bread of his holy word: to the end we might be drawn as it were by degrees, by our bodily food to attaine vnto ſpirituall life: and thereby eternally liue in bliſſe, which neuer ſhal haue end. And in deed, the eternall God brought the children of Iſrael heereunto, by that <hi>Manna</hi> wherwith he fed them in the wilderneſſe. Whereupon, it will come to paſſe, that if we doe, as many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did, who made none other reckoning but of ſtuffinge their paunches, and thereby looked into none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter: that wee alſo ſhal die, euen as they did. For as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for vs to liue heere in this world, without the vſe of bread and other food, which God the Creator hath ordeined, as means wherby he adioyning thereto his heauenly power, would ſuſteine vs in this corporal life: Euen ſo likewiſe is it as impoſſible for vs to be partakers of euerlaſting life, except we be fed with this food of the ſoule: wherewith being appointed by God, to the ſame end, the holy Ghoſte ſerueth as it were for an inſtrument, to cauſe vs poſſeſſe, through a liuely and true faith Chriſte Ieſus, who is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone giuen to vs for life, and without whom, we continually abide in death. Wherefore, ſeeing the ſoule is more excellent then the body, the heauenly bread more precious then corruptible bread, and euerlaſting life, farre more worth, then the tranſitory life for a day, it is moſt certaine, that heauenly benefits are without al com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, a great deale more excellent then corporal, and to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before them. Now, if wee woulde at the leaſt conſider, as in deede wee ought, what a benefite were it, to haue the true feare and knowledge of God, in ſteede of being altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant thereof, and contemning the ſame: to truſt ſurely in him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, in ſtead of truſting too too muche vnto our ſelues: vnfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedlye to loue our neighbors, in ſteade of enuying and hating of them, before wee are regenerate: and to haue a pure and
<pb facs="tcp:7663:3"/> ſounde heart belonging to euerlaſting life, in ſteade of all ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, wherein wee bathe and feede our ſelues as fiſh in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? To bee ſhort, if wee thinke it no ſmall matter, that all ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall giftes: altogether aboliſhed in man through ſinne, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to vs, through Chriſt Ieſus alone: and that, reaſon, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, iudgement, will, and other ſuch naturall giftes, which man had of his Creator, howbeit, corrupted by the ſame fall, be likewiſe, through the ſame Sauiour renued in vs: and to ſpeake in one word, if the image of God, which was defaced by man his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, bee repaired in vs by our Redeemer, who alone hath reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled vs to God his Father, cleanſing vs from our ſinnes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vs his brethren, and enheritors of the kingdome of heauen, freed from the tyranny of ſinne, and of the Deuill, empoueriſhing himſelfe to make vs Princes, and companions with Angels, and by his death recouering vs life: If theſe ineſtimable benefites (I ſay) be not lightly conſidered of vs, we ſhould eſteeme of them, as it is good reaſon, aboue all other things, yea, we ſhould leaue &amp; forſake all other things, to ſeeke and enioy them, and neuer bee wearied with any paine, neither yet faint hearted, ſeeing it is the bread of the word of God that wee muſt all, ſeeke after. And this bread, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other vertues, hath this, that is, it maketh him who is daily fed therewith, more and more encreaſe in the vnitie of faith, vntill ſuch time as hee commeth to the fulneſſe of a perfect man. And without fayth there is no ſaluation, and fayth (as the Apoſtle witneſſeth) commeth by hearing, and hearing commeth by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word, ſo that without hearing of the word preached, there can be no fayth, and conſequently, no ſaluation. This bread alſo of the word hath ſo pleaſant a taſte, as that if the ſweetneſſe of honie it ſelfe, be compared with it, it ſhall be as bitter as Gal. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the godlieſt and beſt fruits of the earth, in reſpect of this which reſtoreth the ſoule, reioyceth the heart, ſtrengtheneth the weake, and comforteth the afflicted, are all but rotten, and no whit plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant or delightfull. To be ſhort, ouer and beſides, that we are with ſo great pleaſure thereby in ſuch ſort ſtrengthened, as no tongue is able to expreſſe, we are moreouer ſo enriched therewith, as that all the treaſures in this world, in regard of it, can be but filthy and ſtinking. And therefore, euery one is to conſider and vnderſtande,
<pb facs="tcp:7663:4"/> that the whole felicitie of man, reſteth in this ſpiritual foode. Here is likewiſe to be ioyned withall, that our labour in trauelling for the ſame, ſhal not be loſt: For, God the Creator, ſendeth vs not at this day (thankes be giuen to him for it for euer) ſcarcitie of this Manna and heauenly doctrine: But moſt abundantly giueth and poureth it abroad without money, all the world ouer, to all ſuch as hunger after it: But vnto ſuch as are full gorged and lothed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, ſo that they reiect it, and caſt it vp againe, by reaſon of their vnthankfulneſſe, it turneth to them in ſtead of good nutriment, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deadly poiſon. And contrariwiſe the more a man deſireth it, the more it nouriſheth, &amp; doth him good. Wherefore our good God, and louing Father, knowing what neede we haue to be ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with this ſpirituall foode, not for a day only, but euen ſo long as we ſhall creepe here vpon the earth, and muſt haue it put into our mouthes like young children, hath appointed Paſtors, &amp; Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in his Church, ſoundly and truly to breake vnto al his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ones, this bread of his word, Euen as a father who giuing bread to his children, cutteth euery one ſuch a morſel, as he ſeeth to bee moſt neceſſarie for him. And therefore in this behalfe (my good Lord) the Church of England, hath greatly to thanke the lord our God, in that hee hath furniſhed it, with ſuch a number of godly, faithfull, and ſound Miniſters, as diſtribute vnto his people the worde of trueth: For they in ſtead of confuſedly heaping &amp; hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling one thing in an others necke, doe verie familiarly and plainely handle and diſpoſe the matter by peece meale, and after an excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t good order: and in ſtead of cutting, tearing in ſunder, wreaſting it into a wrong ſenſe, and reſting in the Barke without making a through entrance, doe ſoundly, perfectly, truely, verie reuerently, and without falſifiyng, deliuer it vnto vs, and feed our ſoules with the marow thereof.</p>
            <p>Wherefore (right honourable) ſeeing this foode of the ſoule which is the word of God, is ſo precious a thing, as that all the kingdomes of the world are not valuable vnto it, I haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to beſeech your honor to be the Patron and defender of this my poore trauell in the tranſlation of theſe Sermons following, which I haue done for the benefit &amp; good of the meanly lettered ſort of my countrimen, verie notably &amp; learnedly handled by M. Iohn Caluin, whoſe authoritie, &amp; ſound dealing in ſuch cauſes, If I
<pb facs="tcp:7663:4"/> ſhould take in hand to commend, I ſhould ſeeme, (as we ſay) with a Lanterne to giue light vnto the bright ſhining Sunne, &amp; therfore wil hold my peace. Againe, the doctrine ſet down by him in them, affourdeth vnto all the Readers therof ſo great commoditie of it ſelfe, as that it needeth not the commendation of any other.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not vnknowne vnto vs (Chriſtian Readers) what the proude ſecte of the Phariſees was, in whom, although there was nothing els but darkneſſe, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, yet boaſted and bragged they of them ſelues, to bee the moſt notable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretors of the lawe, inſomuche, that from thence they tooke their name, as if the verie marowe, and ſecret meaning of the ſcriptures had beene encloſed and faſt ſhut vp in their breaſtes. And yet in the meane while, in ſtead of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the poore people with true and wholeſome doctrine, they inſtructed them I know not with what mockeries and vaine ceremonies, which they them ſelues had inuented, cleane beſides the worde of God. And ſo, after the like manner doe our great Doctours of Sorbone, and all our howling Monkes and Fryers deale at this day with vs: of which company, the one ſorte of them, although they thinke them ſelues to be the pillers of the Church, fellowes with the Apoſtles, and the verie ſhoppe of the holie Ghoſt, from whence wee muſt fetch the full expoſition of the ſcriptures, and the verie aſſured reſolution of all the pointes of religion, yet tell they vs nothing els but vaine and doltiſh tales, either buſie them ſelues about curious queſtions, and ful of Sophiſtrie, beſides a thouſand other ſubtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſeruing to no edification in the whole world. The other ſort of them, in ſtead of the word of God, preach nothing els, but conſtitutions and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunces of their owne making, for the eſtabliſhing of the tyrannie of their holie Father the Pope, the verie Antechriſt and enemy to the truth: and the third ſort, vomit and caſt vp arrogant and proude ſpeeches in the Pulpyt againſt the children of God, &amp; againſt all ſuch as Ieſus Chriſt hath reuealed him ſelfe vnto, in theſe latter dayes, calling them Lutherans, and ſeditious perſons, falſly deuiſing a thouſand leaſings againſt them, and in ſteade of feeding their miſerable ſtarued ſheepe with the true foode of the worde of God, they are faine to moyſten their ſoules with thoſe peſtilent
<pb facs="tcp:7663:5"/> kindes of poiſons, whereas they ſhould be fed with ſpiritual and heauenly nurriture.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, dearely beloued brethren in our Lorde and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, whenſoeuer that God ſendeth vnto vs any good and faithfull tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, who ſincerely and purely deliuereth vnto his Auditorie the worde of the Lorde, wee ought to make a meruellous great account of him: for, we ſhal finde verie few ſuch men as will faithfully acquite them ſelues of their charge and function: and we ought amongſt other things greatly to reuerence all thoſe whom God hath endowed with ſpeciall graces and the gift of enterpreting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Euen as at this day the faithful Paſtor and good ſeruant of God Iohn Caluin, hath made that precious tale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him verie profitable, whoſe Sermons yelde vnto vs a good te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony therof, which alſo, (in the iudgement of indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t men) were not ſlightly made, nor haſtily hudled vp, but duely &amp; truely premeditated and rightly deliuered vnto the capacitie of his flocke, hauing alwayes in open ſhew, the liuely impreſsion of the benefit of the Lord Ieſus in their hearts. Neither are theſe like vnto common places caught in a net, either yet bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Sermons, which may ſerue for any text of ſcripture, as a ſtoole for al feete: But are true, ſincere, plaine, and meete expoſitions ſeruing for the text which he had to treate of: neither are they ſtuffed with friuolous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations: either yet filled with ambitious inuectiues. For, as it is verie needful that the ſuperſtitions of Poperie ſhoulde, by the worde of God, bee daily enueighed againſt, to the ende they, might be cleane rin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſcowred out of our heartes, as a ſtrong ſauour wherewith we haue beene ſeaſoned euen from our infancie, yet if the place which hee hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led did not orderly ſpeake againſt ſuch abuſes, hee woulde not paſſe the boundes of his Texte, and crye out, vpon them: as the Papiſts, alwaies, and to no purpoſe, like Maſtife Curres barke and baye againſt the Goſpell, renued in this latter age of the worlde: But his manner was to holde a plaine and direct courſe, tending to edification, without omitting any thing which might ſerue and make for the honour of God, and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Auditorie. I woulde, if it pleaſed God, there were a great many moe his lyke: For then I knowe, that the Church of Chriſt, ſhould be greatly eaſed and furthered: But it is out of al doubt, that our vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe is the cauſe why God ſendeth not moe faithfull Paſtours at this preſent then are: for if there bee any that will duetifully diſcharge their office, and deliuer the word of God freely (as Saint Paule commaundeth) reproouing ſinne, and ſetting them ſelues againſt iniquitie, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce
<pb facs="tcp:7663:6"/> of his honour, by whom they are ſent, they are foorthwith fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly dealt with, rayled on, and ſlaundered. As queſtionleſſe, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie before ſaide, who for his vprightneſſe, and great fidelitie by him vſed in the executing of his charge, hath gotten ſuch a mightie number of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as that they which neuer ſee nor heard him, neither yet euer read two wordes of his woorkes, haue wiſhed his death. Howbeit, God be thanked for it, his good conſcience and the teſtimonie which hee had before God, his Angelles, and the faithful which daily heard him, did ſo aſſure him that men did him wrong for wiſhing of him ſo great hurt, as that they encouraged him, conſtantly to purſue the Lordes workes. He ſawe howe hardly his maiſter was dealt with, and after him the Apoſtles: and therefore it greeued him not to follow their ſteppes, becauſe he knew that God was of power able to defende and keepe his pledge, and that they which ſuffred for his ſake, ſhould be taken to be worthie of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen. Nowe, becauſe all men could not bee of that Church whereby they might be partakers of the heauenly foode which this good ſhepheard many yeares ceaſed not to adminiſter: and that it was very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient that they which were newly come to the charge which hee had, might ſee his manner of teaching, and ſo followe it: and likewiſe, that they which thought hee did nothing els but ſpeake euill and crye out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pope, and all his rable of ſhauelinges, thundring againſt their traditions, without any other handling of the Scripture, or els that hee went about none other thing but to bring the people vnto a carnal liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and thereby caſt of the obedience and ſubiection which they ought to Kinges and Princes, to the end therefore that they might read his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and thereby ſee that hee hath great iniurie done vnto him in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this blame laide vpon him, and ceaſe the yl opinion which they haue conceiued of him, many godly honeſt men determined to prynt a certein of them, but eſpecially Lawrence of Normandie, whoſe zeale and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuerſation is ſufficiently wel knowne, &amp; hath for many yeares beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed all his ſtudie &amp; trauel to prynt bookes for the edifiyng of the Church. In verie deede, I muſt needes ſay thus much (as I haue in the preface of the Sermons of the tenne Commaundementes let you before vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande) that the Authour was not willing nor yet conſenting here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too: not that hee woulde hinder the benefite and fruite that hereby might redounde to the Church: but wiſhed that his Sermons might paſſe no further then vnto his owne flocke: as well for that they
<pb facs="tcp:7663:6"/> were ſpecially made for his ſheepe, vnto whoſe capacitie he fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him ſelfe the beſt he could: and therefore thought that an other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and diſpoſition were more requiſite therin for the publiſhing them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode in the view of al the world: but as for the ouer looking of them to the ende to poliſh them, ouer and beſides that his leaſure would not ſerue him, hee would neuer buſie himſelfe about the matter. For if he himſelfe had meant to haue put them foorth, he intended to haue made new homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of them, and better penned, and not to haue publiſhed any thing ſode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoken by him. Neuertheleſſe, we ſeeing the great benefite which might come by the putting abrode of theſe Sermons, were not afeard ſomewhat to diſpleaſe and diſobey him heerein, to the end we might make you par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of thoſe excellent riches, which wee poſſeſſe in this litle Angle and corner of the world, ſo abhorred and deteſted, howbeit precious in the ſight of the Lord. In deede we were ſo much the bolder, by reaſon of the liberal dealing of our honorable Lords and magiſtrates, who deſiring the aduancement of the Church of God, haue priuiledged vs to print them.</p>
            <p>Now, when we ſee that we were to make choyſe of ſuch a great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of collections as were of them, we thought it beſt to ſet a few of them abrod to the end that as we ſee them thankefully receiued, ſo alſo we might goe forward in putting foorth of moe. This then is the order which wee haue taken.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, we haue ſet downe a congregation vpon the beginning of the Goſpell of S. Iohn, where is largely handeled the diuinitie of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Now by this word <hi>Congregation,</hi> I meane a certaine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, which is made one day in the weeke at the Church, where euery Miniſter in order handleth ſome text of the ſcripture, more like the maner of a reading then of a preaching: that being done, if any of the reſt vnto whome the ſpirite of God hath reuealed any thing tending to the better vnderſtanding and laying open of that which hath beene ſpoken, hee hath free libertie to ſpeake.</p>
            <p>After that foloweth the Sermon, touching the natiuitie of Ieſus Chriſt. Next to it wee haue placed the Sermons of his death and paſſion, of his reſurrection and aſcention, of the comming downe of the holy Ghoſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Apoſtles, Of the firſt Sermon that Peter, made after he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the holy Ghoſt. Laſt of al, we haue ſet downe a Sermon treating of the laſt comming of Ieſus Chriſte.</p>
            <p>After we had thus doone, and thinking to haue finiſhed this booke it pleaſed God to graunt vs to come to the hearing of the moſt excellent ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mons
<pb facs="tcp:7663:7"/> that are poſſibly to be hard or ſpoken, vpon the end of the fiftie two Chapter of the Prophet Iſaiah, &amp; vpon al the fiftie three, wherin the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the death and paſſion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte is ſet foorth, and ſo liuely pictured out that a man would thinke that the holy Ghoſt meant to ſet before our eyes Ieſus Chriſt condemned in our name, and nayled to the croſſe for our ſinnes, to the end that he ſuffering the puniſhmente for them which was due to vs, and bearing the wrath and iudgement of God for our ſakes, hath deliuered vs from eternal death, which Sermons doe ſo agree with the Sermons going before, which wee haue heere ſet downe, that wee coulde not chooſe to ioyne them vnto them, becauſe we woulde not bereaue you of ſo great a benefite. Moreouer, wee haue had reſpect to chooſe out thoſe Sermons aſwell as we coulde, which were vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch dayes as the Lordes Supper was adminiſtred in this Churche, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well for that that there is a farre greater and more effectuall vehemencie in them, as alſo for that the point of this Sacrament is therein more cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed, for the which at this day, is the greateſt contention and ſtriefe in the worlde. And therefore we haue determined hereafter too deliuer vnto you the Sermons, which this godly learned man hath made vpon the tenth and the eleuenth Chapter of the Epiſtle of S. Paul to the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, wherein is manifeſtly ſet foorth the true inſtitution of the Supper &amp; the corruption and abuſe which ſithence haue come vnto it, liuely refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Wherefore, if wee perceiue that theſe preſents like you, wee will vſe all the meanes poſſible that God ſhal graunt vs, to make you partakers of the heauenly riches, which he vouchſafeth vpon his ſeruants heere in this Church. In the meane while wee beſeech you dearely beloued to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that bleſſed courſſe, and not feare the threats and cruelties of tyrants, who thinke at this day to do god high ſeruice in perſecuting Ieſus Chriſt in his members: and ſet before you this incorruptible crowne and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting prepared for you, if you conſtantly perſeuere vnto the ende in your holy calling, knowing that the ſufferings which you abide in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, are not worthie the glory of the life to come: wherevnto wee may attaine through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

It is true that wée ought not to ſtand ſimply or onely vpon the words: and yet for all that we are not able to comprehend howe excellent Gods doctrine is, vnleſſe wée knowe the procéeding that it vſeth, and alſo what is the ſtyle and ſpéech therof. And indéed we are ſo much the more to marke and weigh this worde, becauſe it is a verie common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued ſentence to diſtinguiſh the holie Scripture into the law and the Goſpell: and thoſe that ſpeake thereof in that ſort, meane,<note place="margin">Diuiſion of the Scripture.</note> that all the promiſes which are conteined in the olde Teſtament, ought to bée referred to this word <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
               <note place="margin">If any man ſpeake, let him ſpeake as the words of God. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11.</note> True it is that their meaning is good, but for all that, the holie Scripture vſeth not ſuch manner of ſpéech, and we ought to be ſober in that reſpect, and to yéelde ſuch a reuerence to Gods ſpirite, as to kéepe ſuch a manner of ſpeaking as hée him ſelfe vſeth to teach vs withall. Behold thus much then concerning the word <hi>Goſpell,</hi> which is a publiſhing that God hath
<pb facs="tcp:7663:8"/> made vnto vs at the comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt his ſonne, declaring him ſelfe a father to all the worlde: as alſo Saint <hi>Paule</hi> ſpeaketh thereof in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephe. 2.19.</note> when hee ſaieth that Ieſus Chriſt came to preach the Goſpel vnto them that were nigh, and to thoſe that were farre of from God: nigh, to wit, the Iewes, who were alreadie entred into the Couenant with God: and farre, to wit, of the <hi>Pagans</hi> and Heathen, who are as it were farre remooued from his Church. Now when wée ſhall haue loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked euerie where, we ſhall finde that this worde <hi>Goſpel</hi> is not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in any other ſignification. And beholde alſo wherefore men haue giuen this name or title to the foure hiſtories that are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten touching our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt how he came into the world, and was conuerſant therein: howe he died, roſe againe, and went vp into heauen: men I ſay, haue giuen the name or title of the Goſpell to this. And why ſo? becauſe the ſubſtance of the Goſpell is comprehended in the perſon of God his ſonne as I haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſaide. The auncient fathers had in déed the promiſes of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:<note place="margin">The difference betwene the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vnder the law, and as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel.</note> they were alſo very well aſſured that God would be their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but yet they had not (in ſuch plaine ſort as we haue) the gage and pledge of Gods loue towards them, &amp; of their owne adoption. For when Ieſus Chriſt came into the world, then God ſigned and ſealed his fatherly loue vnto vs, and we had the full teſtimonie of life, and in déed haue alſo the ſubſtance thereof in Ieſus Chriſt, as I haue alreadie ſaide.<note place="margin">

                  </gap>. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20.</note> And this is the cauſe why S. Paule ſaieth, <hi>That all Gods promiſes are in him, yea and Amen:</hi> to wit, becauſe then God ratified and confirmed all that which he had ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and had promiſed to men. So then it is not without cauſe that theſe foure hiſtories (wherin is declared vnto vs how the ſonne of God was ſent, that he tooke mans fleſh, alſo that he liued here vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon earth amongſt men) haue béen ſo named. Men then haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended all this vnder the worde <hi>Goſpell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.8.</note> becauſe therein it is declared and ſet out vnto vs, howe God hath made perfect and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed all that which was requiſite for mens ſaluation, and that we haue had the fulfilling of al, in the perſon of his ſonne. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déed S. Paul ſpeaketh of his Goſpell, but after what ſort? It is not as though he had writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an hiſtory of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpel, but becauſe his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was conformable &amp; agréeable, to all that which is conteined therein. So according to that which I haue alreadie ſaide, when
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7663:8"/> the Goſpel was preached vnto vs,<note place="margin">S. Paules E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the goſpell, &amp; in what ſenſe</note> it is a plaine manifeſting of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to the ende that we ſhould know that in him all things are perfected, and that we haue the trueth of that, which had béen promiſed in all times before. And yet for all this, S. Paules Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, are not called the Goſpell. And why ſo? becauſe that therein wee haue not a continuall hiſtorie which declareth vnto vs after what ſort God ſent his ſonne, howe it pleaſed him that in putting vpon him our nature, hée might haue a true brotherhood with vs, how he died, roſe againe, and aſcended into heauen. This I ſay, is not largely laid out, with a continual order &amp; courſe of ſpéech in S. Paule, very certaine is it, that the doctrine which is conteined in his Epiſtles, is conformable and agréeable with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine of the Goſpel: But for all that, that word <hi>Goſpell,</hi> is ſpecially attributed to theſe foure hiſtories, for the reaſon which I haue alreadie alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Nowe where we ſay that the ſubſtance of the Goſpell is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the perſon of the Sonne of God, this is not onely to ſay that Ieſus Chriſt came into the world, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhould know alſo what his office is, what charge God his father hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him, and what vertue &amp; power he hath, which thing wée ought to mark wel: for from thence we may gather the difference of the Goſpel according to S. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Wherin the 4. Euangeliſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.15.</note> and thoſe which the other thrée wrote. The foure Euangeliſts agrée verie well in this, that they declared vnto vs, how the ſonne of god appeared in the world, that he became true and verie man, like vnto vs in all thing, ſin excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Afterwards they declare vnto vs, how he died, roſe again, and aſcended into heauen. To be ſhort, all that was committed vnto him, to draw vs to God his father by, is declared and ſet foorth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs therein. But there are two thinges which are peculiar to S. <hi>Iohn:</hi> One is,<note place="margin">Iohn hath two things peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar too him ſelfe from the other Euangeliſts.</note> that he ſtayeth and ſtandeth vpon the doctrine of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, more then the other Euangeliſts doe: The other, that with a greater liuelineſſe he declareth vnto vs Ieſus Chriſtes ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and power. True it is, that the other Euangeliſts ſpeake well of the doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt, but that is rather briefly and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as who haue collected ſome ſmall Summaries and Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes thereof.<note place="margin">

Iohn</hi> maketh a long and large declaration therof, as we ſée in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſixth Chapter, where mention is made of that myracle which he wrought in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wilderneſſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he refreſhed &amp; fed ſo great a multitude. For therevpon <hi>S. Iohn</hi> commeth to enter into
<pb facs="tcp:7663:9"/> ſpéech, and to ſhewe howe Ieſus Chriſt is the bread of eternall life. We ſée then this doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt, which was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at large by <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> and that with a more great dilating &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing thereon, then is ſet out by the other Euangeliſtes, yea we ſée that they quite and cleane omitted that doctrine. So much alſo may be ſaide of the reſt: for after that he hath touched ſome my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and hiſtories,<note place="margin">Iohn. 12. <hi>to</hi> 18.</note> hee alwayes commeth backe to the doctrine, and taketh occaſion to enter into the matter, to handle and ſpeake of the power of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: as from the xii. Chapter til you come to the hiſtorie of the Paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he intreateth of nothing,<note place="margin">The Goſpel ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to S. Io. giueth light to the other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſtes.</note> but this doctrine. So then now we ſée what difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the Goſpell according to S. Iohn, &amp; the other thrée Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſtes, inſomuch, that to ſpeake rightly, the Goſpell according to S. Iohn, is, as it were the key, to giue vs ſome entraunce and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to the other. For if we reade S. Matthew, S. Marke, and S. Luke, we ſhall not ſo well know wherefore Ieſus Chriſt was ſent into the worlde, as when we ſhal haue read S. Iohn. Hauing reade S. Iohn, we ſhall knowe afterwardes to what ende it ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs, that Ieſus Chriſt hath wrought, and alſo that he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken mans fleſh, and that he died and roſe againe: We ſhal know I ſay, what is the ende and ſubſtaunce of all theſe thinges in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this Goſpell. And this is the cauſe why hée ſtandeth not ſo much vpon the hiſtorie, as we ſhall ſée by the order which he will kéepe hereafter. It is true, that theſe thinges rightly deſerue, to be more largely diducted and layde out: but becauſe there is great matter in the Text which we haue to expounde, I doe but touche theſe thinges as briefly as I can. Wherefore let vs content our ſelues with that which we haue ſummarily and ſhortly touched, concerning the office of Ieſus Chriſt:<note place="margin">Wherefore Chriſt came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world.</note> that is to ſay, that S. Iohn declareth vnto vs how he was ſent of God his father, to the ende he might accompliſh and make perfect the ſaluation of men. Hée declareth howe he tooke mans fleſhe, and howe he died alſo, and roſe againe, that he is the pledge of Gods loue, that he is (as it were) the ſoule of our redemption, and that Gods promiſes are in him ratified and eſtabliſhed.<note place="margin">The ſumme of the Goſpell ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to S.

Iohn toucheth the ſtories more briefly then the other thrée Euangeliſtes doe, but for all that he ſtayeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe more vpon the ſubſtance of the matter, that is to ſay, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7663:9"/> vnto vs what the doctrine of Ieſus Chriſt is: &amp; what charge God the father hath committed vnto him: and to be ſhort, what is his vertue, his power, and goodneſſe towardes vs. As concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſignification of the worde in it ſelfe, <hi>Goſpell</hi> is as muche to ſay, as a good newes or glad tidinges: but this woorde ought to be vnto vs as it were hallowed or ſanctified, to the end to cauſe vs to hate the thinges of this worlde, and to the ende that wée might know, that all our goodneſſe and our felicitie, ioye, and glorie is in Ieſus Chriſt alone. Wherfore when we ſhal pronounce or ſpeake this worde <hi>Goſpell,</hi> which is as muche to ſay, as good newes or glad tidinges: Let vs learne not to reioyce beyond meaſure, in the thinges of this worlde which are brittle and vaine: let vs not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in delightes, in pleaſures, nor in any thing whatſoeuer it be:<note place="margin">Wherein true Chriſtians ſhould chiefly reioyce.</note> but let vs be glad and reioyce in this, that Chriſt was ſent vnto vs, that God is offered and giuen vnto vs in his perſon: that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is come to the ende that he might be our reconciliation betwéene God and vs, that God accepteth vs for his children, to the end we ſhould not periſh and be condemned. Behold how this word ought to be ſanctified or hallowed vnto vs, to the end to cauſe vs reuerently to regarde that ineſtimable goodneſſe, which hath béene brought vnto vs by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaide, that this Goſpel is according to <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> to the ende wée ſhould know, that it is not from a mortall man, but that <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> was onely the miniſter or meane thereof. From whom then ſhall we ſay that we holde the Goſpell? From <hi>S. Iohn,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Goſpell is from Ieſus Chriſt. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 7.16.</note> or from Ieſus Chriſt? Certainly from Ieſus Chriſt. And in déede Ieſus Chriſt vſeth this manner of ſpéech, as to ſay, that the doctrine is not his, but that hee preached it in the authoritie of God his father from whom it procéeded: and al this is to the end that we ſhould beare ſo much the more reuerence to this doctrine, and that we ſhould not receiue it, as a common thing, but as the pure truth of God, which was preached and declared by his onely ſonne. <hi>S. Iohn</hi> then was indéede the meane or inſtrument that God vſed, euen as a Penne that will write in a mans hande, but yet for all that we muſt not receiue the Goſpell, which was written by him, as from a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man. Let vs nowe come to the Text. <hi>The worde</hi> (ſaieth hée) <hi>was in the beginning.</hi> The purpoſe of Saint Iohn is to declare vnto vs howe the ſonne of God did not then begin to be, when hée
<pb facs="tcp:7663:10"/> appeared or ſhewed himſelfe in the world:<note place="margin">Chriſt is verie God from all eternitie.</note> neither yet that then he began onely to ſpread abroad his power in euery place, (for he was alreadie from al time, and before all time, his power abroad alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die in him ſelfe, and he tooke it not from any other) but that there was a power which was in the word of God from the beginning, which at the laſt was manifeſted, and we know it now, ſéeing Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath béen ſent into the world. Wherfore S Iohn ment to declare here, that when Ieſus Chriſt came into the worlde, hée that came was our eternall God, who alſo hath redéemed vs. But yet to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end that we may the better vnderſtand the whole, we muſt particularly &amp; by péecemeale mark the things that are here ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>The word was in the beginning.</hi> There is no doubt, but that hée héere calleth the Sonne of God <hi>The worde.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Why Chriſt is called the word</note> The reaſon is, becauſe it is that verie wiſedome which hath alwayes béene in God, and his Counſell, and his power. True it is, that we haue not in this place the thinges declared and ſet out, as they are in their owne greatneſſe &amp; excellencie, I meane, euen as they are here propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſet foorth vnto vs by S. Iohn. For albeit that the ſpirite of God ſpake by his mouth, yet ſo it is, that he hath not yet declared and ſet forth the matters vnto vs, in their greatneſſe and maieſtie. And héerein we derogate nothing from the ſpirit of God,<note place="margin">The Lord in ſetting out him ſelfe and Chriſt to vs, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to our weakneſſe.</note> when we ſay, that he hath not fully &amp; in perfection ſet out the thinges which are héere ſignified vnto vs, for the holie Ghoſt therein applieth him ſelfe vnto our infirmitie and weakeneſſe. And in déede, if wée ſhoulde heare God, ſpeaking vnto vs in his maieſtie, it ſhoulde be vtterly vnprofitable for vs, becauſe we could comprehende or conceiue nothing thereof.</p>
            <p>So then, becauſe we be carnall, he muſt néeds ſtut and ſtammer as it were, or els he would not be vnderſtoode of vs. By this then we ſée, that we are to vnderſtand, that God is as it were become litle, and hath abaſed him ſelfe, that he might declare him ſelf vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs: And that ſo it is, tell mée, howe ſhould it bee poſſible to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe what Gods maieſtie is, If we ſpeake mens ſpéech &amp; words? Is it not thinke you a farre vnequall meaſure? S. Iohn then albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it he be the holie Ghoſts inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſpeaketh not of theſe matters, according to their greatneſſe, &amp; yet notwithſtanding he ſpeaketh in a ſpéech, which is as it were vnknowne to vs. And therefore wée muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that the ſecrets which are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined in this place, are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7663:10"/> not ſo openly &amp; plainly declared, as that we are able to vnderſtand the ſame, in ſuch ſort as we vnderſtand the matters of the world: but let vs content our ſelues with that which is here ſimply decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs: for our Lord knew y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which was ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for our good,<note place="margin">God hath in his word reuealed ſufficient for his children,</note> and he applied himſelf vnto vs and our infirmitie, in ſuch ſort that he hath not forgotten or omitted any thing which was good &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for vs to know. So let vs learne to kéepe vs faſt to this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and ſimplicitie of his doctrine, conſidering how the worlde in this behalfe hath béen foulely abuſed by fooliſh imaginations, and vaine ſpeculations, and by a certaine deuiliſh boldneſſe: For when the queſtion hath béene to handle theſe matters, men haue ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed them ſelues in as much as they ment (beſides the reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the doctrine) to ſearch out w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a certain curioſitie &amp; boldnes, the eternal eſſence and being of Almightie God: as a man in the Papacie ſhall heare diſputations that are made thereof, euen as if men diſputed of a flocke of Goates, or I know not whereof. They haue no more reuerence to God, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to a beaſt: Now we néede not ſéeke out a better witneſſe againſt the doctrine of the <hi>Sophiſters</hi> of <hi>Sorbone</hi> to know that the Deuill raigneth there,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sorbone,</hi> is the name of the place, wher the brotherhood of the <hi>Sorbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> doe yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine to this day in <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </note> and hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes raigned there, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this. And this I ſay, that albeit their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine were not falſe, yet ſo it is that when men ſée they haue ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reuerence and regard to Gods maieſtie, we muſt néeds ſay that it is a deuiliſh doctrine, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that I mean, which is at this day prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, by the <hi>Sophiſters</hi> &amp; <hi>Sorboniſts,</hi> in all the Popes Colledges. So then, let vs (as I haue ſaide) content our ſelues with that ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie, which is declared vnto vs by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſpirite, for he toucheth and ſpeaketh of that which is good &amp; profitable for our ſaluation: and as I haue alreadie declared he hath heere brought and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs that which was méete &amp; fit for vs to knowe.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iam.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29.</note> Let vs come now to this true <hi>word.</hi> When S Iohn calleth Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>That word,</hi> it is as if he ſhould ſay: the eternall counſell of God, or the wiſdome that remaineth in him. Notwithſtanding we muſt marke that God is not like to men: when we haue a Counſell it may alter and chaunge, but it is not ſo with God: for that which is in God is vnchaungeable. Beſides the counſell which we haue,<note place="margin">Though man be wauering, yet God is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. <hi>Iames</hi> 1.17.</note> is not our verie Eſſence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſubſtance: but the counſell which is in God, is verely &amp; truly God: for God is not as a vaile or couerture, wher ther are ſhadowy places, as <hi>S. Iam.</hi> vſeth this ſimilitude, we
<pb facs="tcp:7663:11"/> are as a ſhadowe that flitteth vp and downe, and we cannot abide firme and conſtant. But this is not in God: for that which is in him, is of his eſſence and eternitie. And this is the cauſe wherfore S. <hi>Iohn</hi> declareth, that this word is verely and truely God. But as concerning the worde, wee muſt not (as I haue alreadie ſaide) imagine a counſell or a wiſedome in God, which ſhould be like to the worde of men. True it is, that we may well take ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon from our ſelues, but yet we ought alwayes to marke, the long diſtance and great difference,<note place="margin">An apt ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> that is betwéene vs and God: for if the heauens be much higher than the earth, much more muſt it néedes be, that we ſhould knowe and confeſſe, that God is more high than we, yea there is no proportion or reſemblance as it were betwéene God and men. So then when men ſhall bring or alledge vnto vs ſome ſimilitude taken from the creatures, wée muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes marke this great diſtance &amp; difference,<note place="margin">There are two partes or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of a mans ſoule, to wit, vnderſtanding and will. See his Inſtitut. <hi>Lib</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 15. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5.7.</note> which is betwéene God and vs. As a man may verie well ſay, that in the ſoule of a man, there is a certaine vnderſtanding, which is in ſuch ſort ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the ſoule, that the ſoule cannot be without vnderſtanding. There is alſo a will, not as when we haue nowe one deſire, nowe another, but a certaine power (as a man would ſay) to wil, which thing man hath in him ſelf, for man is not as a ſtone, or as a pile of wood without ſenſe and reaſon, but he hath imprinted in him this propertie, to will this or that. So then we may take and vſe ſuch ſimilitudes: but yet notwithſtanding we muſt conſider, that ſpéech is here had of ſo high thinges, as of neceſſitie all mans vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and wit muſt be abaſed and brought low: and we muſt han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle them, and intreate of them in all humilitie, applying them to their true meaning,<note place="margin">Curioſitie and vaine imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt be auoided.</note> &amp; muſt not be ouer curious: we then haue that fonde imagination which hath borne ſwaye and ruled heretofore in the worlde: but we muſt come to Gods ſchoole, to hearken to that which he ſhall ſpeake vnto vs, and to flye from al that which men ſhall ſet out,<note place="margin">Gods voice muſt onely be obeied.</note> and ſhalbe founde contrarie to that, which the holie Ghoſt hath left vs. Nowe furthermore we muſt alſo marke, that ſome hauing been thruſt forwarde by the deuill, haue peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the meaning of this doctrine, affirming that this worde was nothing els,<note place="margin">A perillous o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> but ſome certaine counſell, deliberation and purpoſe that God had to redéeme mankinde in the perſon of Ieſus Chriſt (who was a certaine forme, as they call him, as when a man ſhal
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7663:11"/> haue purpoſed to doe ſome worke, and ſhall haue conceaued the ſame in his ſpirite or vnderſtanding) leauing not by ſo ſaying, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſtingnes of eſſence or being to the ſonne of God. But we ſée alreadie, &amp; ſhall ſée héereafter more largely, how and in what ſort S. Iohn calleth Ieſus Chriſte that worde of God, thereby to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare &amp; ſet out his deitie, as I haue alredy ſaid. And that ſo it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a plaine teſtimonie of God himſelfe, for he ſaeith, that this worde was in the beginning: ſo then it muſt néedes be, that it hath béen eternall &amp; euerlaſting.

               <hi>that God in the beginning created heauen &amp; earth:</hi> and that now S.

But the anſwere is eaſie: to wit, that when Moſes ſpeaketh of the beginning,<note place="margin">An obiection anſwered.</note> we are to remember &amp; mark whereof he ſpeaketh: that is of heauen, of earth &amp; other things, that haue indéede a beginning. But now let vs weigh and marke, that which S. Iohn ſaith, <hi>In the beginning</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was that word.</hi> And where was the beginning? verely in God. And what is Gods beginning, I pray you? Certainely he had none: for otherwiſe it muſt néeds be, that God ſhould be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med &amp; made. So that when mention is made of the beginning of God, we muſt conclude, that it is ſuch a beginning, as hath not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time at al. There is then much to be ſayd, and great difference alſo betwene Moſes his place, when he ſaith,<note place="margin">Ieſus Chriſt i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>that God created all in the beginning,</hi> and this when it is ſaid, <hi>that that worde was in the beginning.</hi> For Moſes ſpeaketh of the creatures, which had their beginning to be at a certaine time. But héere S. Iohn ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not of any thing but of God, which cannot be without his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie and euerlaſtingnes. Wherefore we muſt conclude, that this beginning, hath not any beginning. And héereby wée ſée that Ieſus Chriſte hath béen alwaies. It is as much then, as if Saint Iohn had ſaide, that Ieſus Chriſt is our eternall God, who hath appeared &amp; béen made manifeſt vnto vs in the fleſh, as alſo Saint Paul ſpeaketh therof. Now he addeth afterwards: <hi>this word was with God:</hi> as if hee ſhoulde ſay you muſt of neceſſitie ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and diſtinguiſhe him from all creatures. Marke the
<pb facs="tcp:7663:12"/> purpoſe of the Euangeliſt. We muſt not ſo much as imagine (ſaith hée) that this word had any thing at all, like vnto creatures: wée muſt go out of the world, wée muſt aſcend aboue the earth &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,<note place="margin">A hard queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on anſwered.</note> when we thinke vpon this word. A man might demaund, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was either heauen or earth, was it poſſible, that this word ſhould be in the beginning? yea in déede, for S. Iohn for a ful anſwere, ſeparateth this worde from all the creatures: as if hée ſhould ſay, when I ſpeake vnto you of this worde, you muſt come to God, for it is in God. Let vs then regard and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider it, as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine eternitie or euerlaſtingneſſe, which is not in the creatures, neither in the heauen, nor in the earth, nor in any thing whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. And notwithſtanding all this, yet ſo it is, that the Euangeliſt in this place ſetteth out vnto vs, a diſtinction betwéene God and his worde.<note place="margin">The father di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincted from the ſonne, not in eſſence, but in perſon. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4.6. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5.</note> And what maner a one is this diſtinction? It is not of their eſſence, for he meaneth alwayes that this word is God: &amp; wée muſt conclude, ſéeing that we haue but one onely God, and that there is but one ſimple eſſence or being in him, that Ieſus Chriſt, that is to ſay, this eternall word whereof mention is made in this place, hath not béene ſeparated or ſundred from God his father, in reſpect of eſſence: and yet notwithſtanding there is ſome diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And howe is that then? thus it is: becauſe we are not able to comprehend that which is ſo high aboue al our vnderſtanding and reaſon,<note place="margin">Howe there are three perſons in the Godhead.</note> the auncient Doctors haue vſed the word <hi>perſons,</hi> &amp; haue ſaide, that in God there are thrée perſons: not as we ſpeake in our common ſpéeche, calling thrée men thrée perſons, or els as in the Popedome, they wil be ſo bold as to point thrée Puppets or Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keyes, and ſay, Loe the Trinitie: but this worde perſons in this matter, is vſed plainly to expreſſe and ſet out the proprieties, that are in the eſſence of God. The word ſubſtance, or (as the Gréekes ſpeake) Hypoſtaſis is in déede more méete and conuenient, becauſe it is a worde of holie ſcripture, and the Apoſtle vſeth it in the firſt Chapiter of his Epiſtle to the Hebrewes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.3.</note> when hée ſaieth, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is the liuely image, and the brightneſſe of the glorie, yea the image or ingraued forme of the ſubſtance or perſon of God his Father. When he ſpeaketh in that place of the ſubſtaunce or perſon of God, hée meaneth not the eſſence or béeing, but hée ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of his proprietie which is in the father, to wit, that he is the fountaine of al things. But now let vs looke to their thrée ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7663:12"/> or perſons, as we call them,<note place="margin">Gods worde onely, muſt be the rule of our faith, in all pointes, but ſpecially in the article of the Trinitie.</note> and marke howe they accord and agrée, ſo farfoorth, as God teacheth vs concerning them (as I haue alreadie ſaid:) for we muſt not at any hand go beyond theſe bounds and limittes. And therefore let vs haue an eye thereto, ſo farfoorth as ſhalbe requiſite, for the expoſition of the place: When men ſpeake of God, true it is that men of them ſelues are confounded, and knowe not what to thinke or imagine, ſauing that they goe aſtraie in their owne cogitations and thoughtes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21.</note> as Saint Paule ſaieth: and therevppon it falleth out, that they waxe thereof ouer proude, through their owne prudencie and wiſedome: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD alſo doeth in ſuche ſort puniſhe them, that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle them ſelues, in ſuch horrible labyrinthes and mazes, that they can not at any hand come out. But when we will ſuffer God to guide vs vnto him ſelfe by the holie ſcripture, we ſhall knowe him ſo farfoorth as ſhalbe neceſſarie and méete for vs.<note place="margin">The Trinitie prooued.</note> For we ſhall come to the father as to the fountaine of all thinges: and then wée can not conceiue or think vpon the father without his counſel and eternall wiſedome: beſides there is a certaine vertue &amp; power that remaineth in him, which we ſhall alſo perceiue &amp; féele verie well. Marke then how we ſhal finde theſe 3. proprieties in the eſſence of God. And this is that which S.

And we muſt not for all that ſo much as imagine or thinke vpon a beginning: for we may not ſay, that God hath at any time béene without his vnderſtanding, counſell, and wiſedome.

And this is that diſtinction of perſons which I haue alreadie ſpoken of, that is, that all things are of God the father, but that Ieſus Chriſt is the meane thereof Marke then what S.

Wherefore God ſheweth that hée is the fountaine of them all and that it muſt néedes bée that hée ſhoulde make and create all thinges, but yet by the meane and power of that his woorde. <hi>And without it nothing was made of that which was made,</hi> Saint Iohn commeth héere to repeate the ſame Sentence,<note place="margin">Two cauſes of S.

Paules ſaying. And by this we ſée the trueth of this ſentence, to wit, that nothing of all that which was made, was made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that worde of God. And this is the order of the reading that hath béen found and obſerued, in all the moſt old Gréeke Doctors,

Furthermore we haue to note, that the <hi>Manichees</hi> laboured to peruert and wreſt this place, (ſaying, <hi>All that was made in him was life</hi>) to prooue their fooliſh opinions: as that all creatures had life in them and were liuing, for example Stones, Trées, Corne, Otes: All this in their fantaſie was liuing, inſomuch that they durſt not eate bread, vnleſſe they were ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of God before hande. And wherefore? hée muſt be good, that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this, woulde they ſay.

Now I ment in déede to touch this by the way, to declare that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill hath alwayes indeuoured to peruert, wreſt and wring the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Scripture: but whatſoeuer it be, if wée ſearch and ſéeke after Gods trueth, wée ſhall finde it pure and ſimple as it is, and the Deuill ſhall not be able to deuiſe or perfourme any thing againſt it or vs, to turne vs away from it, becauſe it is ſhewed and ſet out vnto vs before our eyes, and it ſhall appertaine to none but to vs, if wée will beholde it in his puritie, and kéepe it in ſuch ſort, as God hath reuealed the ſame vnto vs. Then let vs come to the naturall meaning. After that Saint Iohn had ſaid, <hi>That nothing was made of that which was made without this worde:</hi> Hée ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>That in it was life.</hi> Nowe héere hée mindeth to ſet out two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers thinges: that is to ſay, that as all was once created by the power of that worde of God: ſo all thinges continue and are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued by that power, and by the ſame meane.<note place="margin">Two thinges worthie to be marked.</note> And theſe are two matters which it behooueth vs wel to conſider and way. The one, that we haue our beginning and life by this <hi>word:</hi> the other, that we are vpholden and mainteined therby, and that not wée onely, but all the worlde: Alſo, that the worlde was not onely created at the beginning by this word, but alſo that it ſhould bée no more nor continue any longer, vnleſſe it were preſerued in it owne eſtate, by the ſame meane. And therefore as I haue ſaide, let vs marke and kéepe faſt,<note place="margin">All things in the world are vphelde by Chriſt.</note> theſe two thinges as they are in this place pointed out vnto vs with the finger by S. Iohn. In the firſt place then hée declareth vnto vs, <hi>That nothing of that which was made, was made without this worde.</hi> And howe then? Mindeth hée to accept I know not what, that was not made? Séemeth it, that he would
<pb facs="tcp:7663:16"/> ſay, that the Angels were not created? No, no, he meaneth no ſuch thing: but mindeth to declare that we haue nothing at all which dependeth not wholy of God, and hath not it being altogether in him.<note place="margin">Touching An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</note> It is true that the Angels haue a very noble and excellent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but yet notwithſtanding they ſubſiſt and haue their being by this word, and are founded in it: otherwiſe they could not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue and abide: As alſo there is nothing in the world but it is preſerued by this verie word.

The firſt is, that after that we haue knowne the might of God, and the power of that his word, both on high, and beneath, and euerie where, we muſt then come to our ſelues: for this is good reaſon, that we ſhould and that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7663:16"/> with a greater diligence beholde that, which toucheth vs verie nigh. As how? I ought to knowe Gods goodneſſe in this, that hée preſerueth, Horſes, and Oxen: as Dauid ſpeaketh to vs therof,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>.</note> ſaying that it is hée that giueth nouriſhment, and foode to euerie beaſt. I ſée on the other ſide the Earth, which by the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and bleſſing of God bringeth foorth her fruites. If I looke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon beaſtes, I ought to knowe the goodneſſe of God which decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it ſelfe euen towards Aſſes, &amp; Dogs, but much more towards mée God commeth to mée, that I might inwardly féele his power: hée giueth mée bread wherewith I am nouriſhed, and ought I not to be touched to the quicke for ſo many benefits &amp; bleſſinges, It is true that I ſhould. Beſides alſo when men ſet out Gods workes, they ſpeak expreſly of men,<note place="margin">Gods power appeareth ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in man.</note> becauſe that God doth ſet out his moſt great &amp; excellent power rather in vs then in other creatures. God then wil in déed be magnified, both in heauen &amp; in earth, and in all his workes that we ſée: but yet much more in a man, becauſe hée hath imprinted his own Image in vs, rather then in all the reſt of his creatures. For he hath not ſaid of the Sun, the Starres, or any other creature how excellent ſoeuer it be,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26.</note> I wil make now a chief worke, which may be to mine owne Image and likeneſſe. So then the Euangeliſt after that he had ſpoken of the power of that word of God, which ſpreadeth it ſelfe to all creatures, hée commeth to men. And in this hée ſheweth vnto vs, that if men beholde the goodneſſe of God in euerie place where they looke, they cannot but much more conſider and beholde the ſame, within their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And foraſmuche as God hath done vs this honour, that wée are magnified &amp; made excellent in our ſelues, inſomuche that the verie <hi>Pagans</hi> and Heathen haue called Man a little world,<note place="margin">Man a little world, and why he is ſo called.</note> becauſe we may ſée in him a principall woorke that ſurpaſſeth all the reſt, good reaſon is it, that we ſhould knowe &amp; confeſſe in it, the vertue and power of God. It is true that wée may behold God in al his creatures, but when hée manifeſteth himſelfe in man, then we ſée him, as it were by face and countenance: whereas looking vppon him in other creatures, wée ſée him darkely, and as it were on the backe partes. So then albeit that it be ſaid, that God is made viſible vnto vs in his creatures, yet it ſo falleth out, that in them we ſée but as it were, his féete, his handes, and his backe: but in Man wée ſée as it were his face. Not that it is his face, ſo that wee can beholde him there in imperfection I meane
<pb facs="tcp:7663:17"/> not ſo,<note place="margin">God is viſible in his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures chiefly in man, but in none can Gods maieſtie be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſet out</note> for I ſpeake not now of diuine and heauenly thinges, but onlye of this, that it hath pleaſed God to be knowne in this world to high and lowe. Beholde then the ſumme of that which S. Iohn ſaieth, to wit, that <hi>that life was that light of men:</hi> as if hée ſhould ſay, It is true, that there is in déede a certaine life ſpread abroade ouer and in all creatures. And what manner a one is that, euen that all thinges are made and preſerued by that worde of God:<note place="margin">Mans ſoule a verie excellent thing.</note> but yet there is a more excellent matter in man, to wit, the ſoule, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding &amp; reaſon. For a man ſhal not be w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out ſenſe &amp; féeling, as ſtones: he ſhall not be w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding &amp; reaſon as brute beaſts: but he hath a more excellent life, yea euen to beholde the thinges which are aboue and beyond the worlde. Nowe conſequently hee addeth: <hi>that that light ſhineth in the darkneſſe, and that the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe comprehended it not.</hi> Hée expreſly putteth downe that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that that light which God placed in man, is as it were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether put out: and in déede if we ſhould iudge according to that which wée nowe can ſée in mortall men, wée ſhall not muche re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and eſtéeme the grace of God. For albeit that man was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the image of God,<note place="margin">Sinne defaced Gods image in man.</note> yet ſo it is, that through ſin he hath béene diſfigured and defamed. What is it then that wée ſée in men? Wée ſée there an image of God which is altogether defaced and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe that the Deuill hath defiled it through ſinne. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that men following altogeather that which Satan prompted them too,<note place="margin">Satan neither by force nor fraud, can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt the light.</note> haue quenched and put out the light of God: yet ſo it is notwithſtanding that the Deuill was not able by his ſubtiltie to bring ſo much to paſſe, that this light of God, ſhould not yet ſhine foorth in the middeſt of darkeneſſe. And this is it that Saint Iohn minded to declare, as if he ſhould ſay, It is true (my children) that if that which was firſt giuen vnto men had continued and abidden with them, wée ſhould haue ſéene nothing now, but the glorie of God ſhining in euerie place, in ſtéede that nowe we behold his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage wonderfully defaced: and yet notwithſtanding all this, if ſo falleth out that wée may perceiue in Man ſome brightneſſe that God hath left him,<note place="margin">Some ſparkes of light remain notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding mans ſoule fall.</note> and ſome little ſparke of that his light. And this is that which the Euangeliſt ment to declare. I leaue vntou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched other things becauſe the time ſuffereth vs not to ſpeake any more thereof, and becauſe I haue alreadie béene ouerlong.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:7663:17"/>
            <p>Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding we are to marke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men haue ſo much light of the knowledge of God, as is ſufficient to winne them, and make them inexcuſable before him.<note place="margin">Men are not what they think of themſelues, but what God pronounceth of them.</note> Let vs indeuer to make our ſelues beléeue of our ſelues what we will or can, yet beholde God, who pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, that we are al darknes. And how ſo? let vs not attribute that vnto GOD, but to our owne fault. Now then, eyther God muſt inlighten vs with his brightneſſe, or elſe otherwiſe there ſhall bée nothing but darkneſſe in vs, and it cannot be auoyded but we ſhal ſtumble and fall downe, if we will but once lift vp our ſelues to go forward one ſtepp, without his guiding &amp; gouernment. And yet ſo it is (as I haue already ſaid) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God hath not ſo deſtituted vs, that wée are altogether forſaken of him, ſo that we haue nothing remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his gifts. And that ſo it is, there is yet ſome ſéed of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in men, they haue yet ſome remnantes of their firſt creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may ſée that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the moſt wicked and reprobate: there is ſome impreſſion and print of the image of God,<note place="margin">Mans light maketh him without excuſe before God, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20.</note> and this is to make them ſo much the more inexcuſable: forſomuch as they haue not profited therby, theyr condemnation ſhalbe therfore ſo much the more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, and without doubt it ſhall bée doubled vpon them. Beholde then how notwithſtanding that our nature was ſo corrupted wée doe yet reteine ſome little ſparke of that grace, which God put in our father Adam: So that this ſentence is verye true, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>that light ſhineth in darkneſſe.</hi> Now further the Euangeliſt ſaith, <hi>that the darkneſſe comprehended it not.</hi> Wherin he ſheweth howe greate the vnthankfulneſſe of men is. Beholde God, who maketh his brightneſſe to ſhine in vs, and his word to lighten vs,<note place="margin">Mans malice the cauſe of his owne blindnes.</note> and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtanding we darke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; dim the ſame through our malice. It is true that the Goſpel it ſelfe, is a manifeſtation and declaration of this light, but yet that malice and vnthankfulneſſe which is in vs, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it out, as much as in vs is, vnleſſe God remedied and redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it, making a change in vs by his power &amp; infinite goodneſſe. And this is that which Saint Iohn ment to declare in this place: and withall he beginneth to prepare vs to that, which hee will ſpeake afterward, that is to ſay, to what ende this word (which is Ieſus Chriſt) was ſent vs of God his father, that is,<note place="margin">The myſterie of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion very great and needfull.</note> to the end he might be manifeſted in the fleſh, for our ſaluation. He ment then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare howe greate the myſtery of our redemption was, and what neede wée had of it, in ſaying, that <hi>wee haue not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
<pb facs="tcp:7663:18"/> the brightneſſe that was in vs:</hi> as if hee ſhoulde ſay, It could nothing at all haue profited vs, to haue the light that ſhineth in vs, vnleſſe we had withall béene redéemed, and that this worde had executed and performed the loue of God towarde vs, in repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his image,<note place="margin">The light of our owne miſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie is a good meane to make vs feele the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</note> which was defaced in vs through our ſinne, and wholie diſfigured in the firſt man. Marke I ſay howe Saint Iohn mindeth to prepare vs to know the effect of our redemption: and beſides hée ment alſo to ſhewe vnto vs, how that the word of God declareth it ſelfe in his creatures, in as much as all things are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued by his ſtrength and power. And withall hée exhorteth vs to knowe and confeſſe, the graces that God hath beſtowed vpon vs, more excellent in déede than vpon other creatures, to the ende wée might magnifie and prayſe him:<note place="margin">The endes of our light and knowledge.</note> moreouer to knowe, that ſéeing hée hath from the beginning imprinted his owne liuely image in vs, and hath made vs féele his power, it is good reaſon wée ſhould learne, to holde our ſelues faſt to this worde, and to confeſſe both generally and particularly, the good thinges that God hath done for mankinde, to the ende that the light which hée hath plentifully communicated vnto vs, of his grace and goodneſſe onely, may not be quenched or put out through our malice, but that Ieſus Chriſt may in ſuch ſort dwell in the middeſt of vs, that being guided and gouerned by the holie Ghoſt, wée may haue ſuch acceſſe to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that hée may at the length bring vs into his heauenly glorie. Thus I haue handled theſe thinges as ſhortly as was poſſible for mée,<note place="margin">What men ſhould looke at in expounding the ſcripture.</note> reſpecting alwayes to touch the marke, wherat the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt in this place aimeth: notwithſtanding if there bee any thing that hath béene omitted becauſe a man can not remember all, let euerie one ſpeake thereof that, which God ſhall haue giuen him in that behalfe: and if there be any doubt, propound the matters, to the ende that putting them out, they may be made cleare and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, and that the Church of God may therby bée more and more edified, when thinges ſhall not remaine in doubt, but ſhall be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood according to their true meaning, after that wée ſhall haue diſputed and reaſoned vpon them, as is ſéemely, and according to God and godlineſſe.</p>

And beſide, we ſee in very déede, howe miſerable our eſtate ſhould be, if wée can not to him, to be preſerued vnder his protection. But by the way, we are neuer able to attaine and reach ſo high (ſéeing we are ſcarcely able to crawle vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ground) without he were alredie come néere vnto vs by reaſon of his birth, who hath taken vpon him our fleſh, and is therby become our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Neither could we at this preſent flye vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt ſitting at the right hand of God his father,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.<hi>5.

And here we may likewiſe ſée, why the name of man was giuen vnto him, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as hée is called the Mediatour betwéene God and man: and ſo by the ſelfe fame reaſon is called <hi>Immanuel,</hi> which is as much to ſay, as God with vs. And therefore as often as wée ſéeke to be relieued and eaſed of our miſeries by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and to make him our ſure and vndoubted defence, wee muſt firſt of all, begin at his birth. Nowe, wee are not onely here taught that he was made man like vnto vs, but was alſo ſo deſpiſed, and made of ſo ſmal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as that he was ſcarcely taken to be named among the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men. For he was as it were baniſhed &amp; denied all harboure and company, and was lodged in a Stable, and laide in Manger. Since the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is thus, let vs here acknowledge that Gods of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hath bountifullie ſpreade abroade his infinite treaſures, when as hee woulde in this ſorte abaſe, his deare Sonne for our ſakes. And let vs alſo acknowledge that our Lorde
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7663:19"/> Ieſus Chriſt hath ſo ſuffred for vs, as that, ſo often as wée ſéeke him, we néede neuer to goe verie farre about, to finde him, nor yet to vnite our ſelues truly vnto him. For, for that cauſe was he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to ſubmit him ſelfe vnto all ſhame and rebuke, inſomuche, that all men as it were vtterly forſooke him. And therefore let vs here learne alſo by the way, humbleneſſe, and lowlineſſe, if we meane that he ſhoulde entertayne vs. For it is verie good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that at the leaſt there ſhould be a conformitie or an euen agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwéene the head and the members. Neither muſt wée ſo deſpiſe our ſelues as to make no reckoning of our ſelues: for wée ſhal by nature finde ſuch pouertie and wants in our ſelues, as that we ſhal haue very good occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> altogether to abaſe our ſelues. But let vs acknowledge our ſelues to be ſuch as in déede we are to the ende we might offer vp our ſelues in true humilitie vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that he might acknowledge &amp; allow vs for his. Wée haue moreouer to note by the way, that in the hiſtory which Saint Luke here reciteth, that on the one ſide we are to learne, that the ſonne of God made himſelf of no reputation, for our ſaluation: and yet on the other ſide, notwithſtanding that he ceaſed not to bee a ſure and vndoubted teſtimonie, that he was the Redéemer of the worlde, promiſed from the beginning: neither tooke hee vpon him our nature, becauſe he was not able to defende and preſerue his heauenly Maieſtie. Both which are heere ſet downe vnto vs: for our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt was laide in a Manger, as one cleane forſaken of the worlde, and in extreame pouertie, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out honour, without reputation, and as one ſubiecte to all bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and ſlauerie: and yet did the Angelles in heauen magnifie him, dooing him all homage and reuerence. And heere in the firſt place, an Angell brought tydinges of his byrth: but hee was ſoone after accompanied with an whole armie, who were all preſent and appeared, as witneſſes ſent from God, to ſhewe, that although our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was ſo abaſed, for our ſaluation, yet was he for all that the King of the whole worlde, and had all thinges vnder his power and rule. And beſide, the place of Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem yelded a good proofe that it was euen hee that was promiſed from the beginning. For the Prophet <hi>Micheah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Micheah.</hi> 5.2</note> had ſo propheci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of him, where it is ſaide, And thou Bethlehem, although thou bee of no great reputation, like vnto a village which maketh no
<pb facs="tcp:7663:20"/> great ſhewe, neither verie well inhabited, yet out of thee ſhall hée, come foorth vnto me, who ſhal be the ruler of my people: whoſe going foorth, haue béen from euerlaſting. And here we ſée, that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath not ſpared himſelfe, to the ende we might haue readie paſſage vnto him, &amp; not doubt but that he will receiue vs as his owne bodie, ſéeing he woulde not only become a mortall man, clothed with our nature, but alſo become like vnto a poore worme of the earth, voide of all felicitie. And therefore, let vs not doubt how miſerable ſoeuer we be, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he will take vs alwayes for his members. Howbeit on the other ſide, we ſée him marked as it were by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hand of God, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end he ſhould be willingly receiued, as the man, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we muſt looke for our ſaluation, &amp; by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are receiued into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdom of God, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which we were before ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. For we ſée a diuine or heauenly power &amp; maieſtie to be in him, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angels tooke him as it were for their ſuperior &amp; ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereigne king: neither muſt we doubt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are vnder his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath wherwithal to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; preſerue vs. Howbeit, let vs know this by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> although he hath ſo abaſed himſelf, yet that it is no whit derogatory fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his diuine power, neither yet any hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to vs, from being ſafe &amp; ſure vnder his gouernment. Here, therfore we ſée y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſum &amp; effect of this hiſtory: which is, that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt place we might acknowledge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne of God, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our mediator, to be linked vnto vs with ſuch a bond, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhould not doubt, but that we are alwayes pertakers, both of his life, &amp; alſo of his riches. And in the mean while, let vs likewiſe acknowledge, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he brought w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> himſelfe to vs, whatſoeuer was requiſit for our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For (as we haue alredy ſaid) he was not made of ſo vile reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that he alwayes kept with him his heauenly power &amp; maieſtie: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the world accounted him to be of no credit, yet neuertheles, he was alwayes not only y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enheritor of this worlde (becauſe hée is head of the Church) but alſo verie God for euer. Moreouer let vs learn of them who are here appointed to be our maiſters &amp; guides, how to come to our lord Ieſus Chriſt. In very déed, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wiſe men of this world, ſo ſwell w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> pride &amp; preſumption, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they will ſcarcely vouchſafe to bee taught of ſimple men, and of ſhepheardes of the fielde: and yet all the wiſedome we haue, is to learne of theſe ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards (of whom we haue here ſpoken) to come vnto our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. For if our heades were fraught with all the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the worlde, to what ende ſerued it if wée had not life, to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7663:20"/> wit, him, in whome, as Saint Paule ſayeth,<note place="margin">Coloſ. 2.3.</note> all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the worlde lie hid. heere wee ſée therefore at which ende we muſt begin: which is, That it is not hurtfull vnto vs to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their ſteppes, who haue ſhewed vs the way to come vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Now God hath not done this honour vnto the mighty men of this world, neyther to the wiſe, nor to the rich, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet to the noble: but hath choſen very ſhepheards for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And ſince it is ſo, let vs follow the order there ſet downe.<note place="margin">Matth. 2.<hi>1.</hi>
               </note> It is very true that the wiſe men came from the Eaſt to doe homage vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt but it ſo fell out, that the ſhepheards firſt beganne, to the end al pride and preſumption might be cut of, and that hée who would be taken for a Chriſtian, might bee as it were a foole héere in this world. Wherefore, let not fooliſh arroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie ſo carry vs away,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.</note> as to iudge of the woonderfull ſecretes of God, after our owne fantaſies, but ſimply woorſhip them. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, let vs conſider of the faith of theſe ſhepheardes, and then wée ſhall thinke it no hard thing to followe them: For, they came to woorſhip the Redéemer of the world: but in what caſe found they him? Forſooth they found him lodged in a Manger, and ſwadled in poore and ſimple ſwadling clouts, according to the ſigne which the Angel had geuen them. Now, this ſtraunge ſight ſéeme to abaſhe them, yea, and to make them goe backe, and not to acknowledge Ieſus Chriſt to be a Sauiour. For the Scribes, and doctors of the Iewes thought in very déede, that the Redéemer which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, ſhould come with great pompe, and bring all the world vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his ſubiection, and be in ſuch woonderfull proſperitie, as that they ſhould haue the world at will, &amp; get al the ſubſtance &amp; riches of the earth into their poſſeſſion. And thus we ſee, that the meſſuage which was told them that they ſhould find him in a Stable ſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in blankets, was ſuch a ſtumbling block vnto theſe poore men, as was able to haue broken the very hearts of them, and make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be of that mind, neuer to come néere our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, but rather altogether to flie his company. Now, we ſée y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this was the ſigne which was geuen of the Redeemer, that he was laid in a Ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as one not worthy the companie and felowſhip of men. And yet woulde not all this withdraw their mindes from the viſiting of him. Their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming then was for this cauſe, to acknowledge him to be as it were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion of them, and would in the end accompliſh and fulfill the promiſe which hée had
<pb facs="tcp:7663:21"/> made them from the beginning, and ſo confirmed them ſelues thereof by this ſpectacle. Seeing then theſe Shepheardes had ſo great fayth, that it ſtraue againſt all whatſoeuer might pull them backe from comming vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, wee ſhalbe worthie double blame, and without all excuſe, except wee learne and take foorth this leſſon in their ſchoole: and make not the byrth of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte (although there appeared no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worldly dignitie, pompe or nobleneſſe therein) a ſtumbling blocke to ſtay, or withdrawe vs from the right way, to come to ſubmit our ſelues vnto him as vnto our ſiege king, and vnto him, vnto whom al power and dominion is giuen both in heauen and earth. And ſurely this is an admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very needful for vs: for as I haue alreadie ſaide, The doctrine of the Goſpell is a very ſtumbling blocke to all proude and fooliſh men, and to ſuche as thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues wiſe, we ſée alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> many fantaſticall felowes ſpurne againſt whatſoeuer is contrary to their owne mindes. On the other ſide, there were many mockers &amp; ſkorners, who were neuer touched with any féeling of their ſinnes: and becauſe they are prophane people, who neuer thinke to come to an account, and know not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other better life then this whiche they ſée héere belowe, they thinke it therefore méere fooliſhneſſe ſo to folow the ſonne of God, and to be acquainted with him. And the more we ſée this, ſo much the more ought this aduertiſement to ſtrengthen vs, to wit, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſonne of God loſeth not a iote of his maieſtie and glorie, neither is any whit leſſened, becauſe he hath abaſed himſelfe for our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but we ought rather to woonder at it, knowing his ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble goodneſſe &amp; loue towardes vs. We ſée then howe we muſt put this doctrine in practiſe, which is, wée muſt not ceaſe to come vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, although we finde not at his handes at the firſt chop, the thing which our fleſh, or naturall affection, deſireth. And although at his birth he was ſwadled vp in cloutes, and laide in a Manger, yet let vs know &amp; be fully reſolued that hee was not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding a Mediatour to draw vs vnto his father, to open the kingdome of heauen for vs, whereout wee were vtterly recloſed. And although euen at this day, he reigneth not gloriouſly, and his Churche deſpiſed, yet remayneth there ſuche a playneneſſe in his worde, as the mightie euen of this worlde reiecte: howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beeit let not vs for all that ceaſe to holde our ſelues vnto
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7663:21"/> him continually, and ſubmit our ſelues vnder his dominion, in true obedience of Faith. As for example, when any man prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, it is not the thing that greatly draweth vs according to our cuſtome. Wée heare a man ſpeake, and what is that? It is of no great dignitie and credite: and beſides, in effect, there is nothing but the worde: on the other ſide, in that which is preached by the Goſpell, there are many thinges which ſéeme to vs to bée againſt all reaſon, if wée ſhoulde iudge thereof after our owne mindes. Let vs therefore vnderſtande that wée ſhall neuer ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelues vnto the thing which God ſheweth and declareth vnto vs, except we humble our ſelues in the firſt place. And for a confirmation which hée hath added vs, vnto his worde, we haue the Sacraments. And will one droppe of water ſuffice to aſſure vs of remiſſion of our ſinnes, and that God hath adopted vs for his children, and that although wée bée fraile, ſhall we notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding bée cloathed with his heauenly glorie, which neuer ſhall decaye? Is it poſſible for vs to take a pawne and pledge of ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and great thinges, in ſo ſmall a deale of water? May a péece of bread, and a little Wine in the Supper of the Lorde ſuffice to aſſure vs that God alloweth vs for his children, that wée liue in Ieſus Chriſt, and no ſeperation betwéene vs? For this might ſeeme rather to bée a matter of nothing, to ſée ſuche Ceremonies wherein is no great glorie and pompe. So then, wée ſomewhat better ſée, this thing whiche is béere ſpoken by the Miniſters, belongeth to vs, and that wée haue to make our profite thereof at this day: to wit, let not vs ceaſe to drawe néere vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, and aſſure our ſelues that hée it is in whome wée muſt finde all goodneſſe, and all ioye and glorie, although it ſéemeth, that hée is yet as it were in the Stable, in the Maunger, and in his ſwadling cloathes: to wit, that there are many thinges which are able to make vs become diſſolute or wanton, or at the leaſt bleare our eyes, that wee ſhall not bée able to perceiue the heauenly glorie which GOD his Father hath giuen him: I ſay in the ſame humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whiche hée tooke vppon vs. For in as muche as hée is GOD, hée hath all thing of him ſelfe (as it is ſaid in the ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter of Saint Iohn) but in that hée is man, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer hée bringeth vs, hée hath receiued of frée gift,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17.</note> that wée
<pb facs="tcp:7663:22"/> might drawe out of his fulneſſe,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.16.</note> and finde in him whatſoeuer is to be deſired, and ſo reſt &amp; content our ſelues in him alone. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, let vs heere note, that the holy Ghoſt meaneth to aſſure vs, that we following the Miniſters who are héere appointed for mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and guides, ought not to feare falling away: for ſéeing, the Shepheardes had none other ſigne but the Stable and a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, wée may ſay: Beholde a ſorte of ſimple idiotes, who are foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly, and without any reaſon, made to beléeue, that this was the Redéemer of the worlde: and yet this woulde bée too too eaſie a matter for vs to doe. And therefore wée might ſtande in doubt: but on the other ſide, the ſhepheardes were confirmed verie cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that hée was the Sonne of God, euen hée that laye ſo in the Manger: to wit, when the Angell appeared vnto them, and after they had heard this ſonge which Saint Luke ſetteth downe, where all the kingdome of heauen beare witneſſe of our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, that hée had all power ouer the creatures both of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth. Let vs therefore learne to receiue (in the aſſurance of the fayth of Ieſus Chriſt) whatſoeuer is héere ſet before vs. For this is certaine and ſure that God meaneth to conuince all thoſe, of vnthankfulneſſe, who at this day vouchſafe not to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip his onely Sonne, ſéeing hée ſent ſuche a multitude of Angels to declare that hée was the promiſed Redéemer. We then haue a trimme way to flatter our ſelues in our incredulitie, as we ſée a number of blockiſh people doe: who make no reckoning of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is written in the Goſpell. There are alſo certaine ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of God ſo ſenſleſſe, as, that whatſoeuer is preached, is to them all one, for they account of it no better then of the telling of fables. Nowe, as many as ſubmit not them ſelues to the woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, are to be condemned of moſt obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and deuilliſh rebellion. And becauſe there are many faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe people, an infinite number of the Angels of heauen ſhal beare witneſſe againſt them: for they are the Miniſters of the trueth of God. Let all the wicked therefore, and as many as lye powdred and ſeaſoned in their ſinnes and corruptions, ſmoothe, and harden themſelues as much as they will in their infidelitie, and they are ſure of this, that they haue ouer many ſufficient witneſſes to ratefie and confirme their condemnation. For the Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen appeared, to the ende wée ſhoulde not bée excuſed, when as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7663:22"/> we will not receiue Ieſus Chriſt for our ſoueraigne King, and ſubmit our ſelues vnto his maieſtie. And therefore by the way, Let vs for our part note, that God procured our ſaluation, when as hée ſent ſuche a multitude of Angelles, that wée might come to our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt with a chearefull minde, without any more diſputing, or doubting. But bée fully reſolued, that wée ſhall finde in him, whatſoeuer is wanting in vs, and that hée will haue wherewith to ſupplye all our pouerties and miſeries: And to bée ſhort, That it is euen hée, by whom God ment to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate him ſelfe vnto vs. And will wée then ſéeke for our life, any other were then in God? Nowe,<note place="margin">Coloſſ. <hi>2.</hi>9.</note> all the fulneſſe of the God-head is in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. And therefore when wée haue ſuche a teſtimonie, it is as much as if God ſtretched forth his armes, to make vs féele his ineſtimable goodneſſe, and onely to ſhewe, that when wée haue fayth in Ieſus Chriſt (I meane no hypocriticall fayth) we might fully reſt on him, and conſidering that wée muſt holde all of him, wée ſhall then be partakers of all his benefites, which wée want, and hunger after. Moreouer, although wée ſée not at this day the Angels, who for that time on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared, yet is this teſtimonie regiſtred, that it might bée autenticall. For the holie Ghoſt hath ſpoken it by the mouth of Saint Luke. Wherefore, let vs be contented that wee haue ſuch a teſtimonie from God, as telleth vs that the Angels haue borne witneſſe of the birth of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, that we knowing that hée was made man, yea, &amp; that of no eſtimation, for our ſakes, might haue an earneſt deſire to attaine vnto the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, to the ende to cleaue vnto him in the true vnitie of fayth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wée are after a while to conſider alſo of the place of his birth, to wit, of Bethlehem. Which thing is no ſmall nor light confirmation, when as we ſée the Sonne of God to be borne, which the Prophet ſo long tyme before had foretolde. For if Ioſeph and Marie had had their houſe in Bethlehem, and remayned there, it had beene no ſtraunge caſe, if ſhée had béen there deliuered, and Ieſus Chriſt to haue béene borne in the ſame place: But the thing which at this day ſhoulde haue ſerued our purpoſe, had béene verie greatly darkened: for it had not béene knowne that the Prophet had not ſaid without cauſe, And thou Bethlehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, although
<pb facs="tcp:7663:23"/> at this day thou be of no great reputation, like vnto a village which maketh no great ſhewe, yet ſhalt thou bring foorth him, who ſhall bée the ruler of my people. But when Ioſeph and Mary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boad in Nazareth, and came vnto the Towne of Bethlehem at the verie time when ſhée was vppon the pointe of her deliueraunce, and Ieſus Chriſte borne, who ſeeth not but that the hande of GOD guided all this géere? And therefore it can not be but that men muſt bée willingly and wickedly blinde, when as they will not acknowledge héere the handie woorke of God, who hath ſet a marke of his onely Sonne, that hée might without all doubt bée receiued, as the promiſed Meſſiah. In verie déede there was good occaſion that made Ioſeph to come vnto Bethlehem, and that was the publike Edict of the Romane Emperour: but to bring a woman thither great with childe, and vpon the point of her deliueraunce, ſurely this was not any man his déede, but the handie woorke of God. And againe we ſée that GOD vſeth ſtraunge kinde of dealing for the accompliſhing of his will. For what imported this Edict of <hi>Caeſars,</hi> but a tyrannicall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection for the taxing of the people of the Iewes, and a laying of a tribute of euerie man at that time, whiche was a ſignification that they ſhoulde not looke for any more libertie: Ieſus Chriſt was promiſed to deliuer the Iewes and all the faithfull from the ſubiection of Satan, and from all tyrannie: and it ſéemed that this Edict was made to cloſe vp the gate, that GOD ſhould neuer accompliſhe the thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had promiſed to his people: and yet this was the meanes to perfourme it. For when Ioſeph and Mary came like poore ſoules to ſerue a Tyraunt, a Pagane, and an Infidell, wee ſée the Prophecie prooue true, that Ieſus was borne in Bethlehem. And GOD him ſelfe (as I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie ſaide) giueth here a full certaintie vnto all his, not to doubt of the birth of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And héere wee ſée howe wée muſt applye the inſtruction of theſe thinges which are heere recited vnto our ſelues. For it was not the meaning of S. Luke, or rather of the holie Ghoſt who ſpake by his mouth, ſimplye to deſcribe vnto vs an hiſtorie of that whiche came to paſſe: But hath on the one ſide laide foorth vnto vs, that GOD ſpared not his onely Sonne for vs:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7663:23"/> and beſides on the other ſide, that hée brought an vndoubted teſtimonie with him that hée was the redéemer of the worlde, and that hée might bée ſo receiued. Let vs nowe conſider with our ſelues to make our profite by this hiſtorie, ſo that wée may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée with the ſong of Angelles in glorifiyng of God, and receiue alſo that whiche it affoordeth vs for the gladding of our ſoules. In the firſt place, The Angell (who brought the meſſage vnto the Shepheardes) ſaide, <hi>Bee not afraide, for beholde, I bring you tydinges of great ioy.</hi> And beſides, this was the common te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of all the multitude of the Heauenly Souldiers, which GOD had ſent, <hi>And peace in earth to men.</hi> And thus wée ſée what it is that wée muſt holde faſt in the firſt place, which is, wée muſte ſéeke all our ioy in Ieſus Chriſte. For to ſay the trueth, when as wee are full of delightes and voluptuouſneſſe, it is without queſtion, wée will bathe our ſelues in all pleaſures: and yet yf wée bée not too too drowſie, yea altogether blockiſhe, our conſciences will neuer bée quiet, but bée tormented with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ende and meaſure: For this worme (whereof the Scripture ſpeaketh) will gnawe vs, our ſinnes will checke vs, and wee ſhall féele that God of very right, is vtterly againſt vs, and our profeſſed enimie. And therefore curſed are all the ioyes of the worlde, becauſe they ſhall bée turned into gnaſhing of téeth, vntill ſuche time as wée are an attonement with God. Curſed then are all ioyes, all honours, and all thinges els that are to bée de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, vntill wée féele Gods mercy vppon vs: and when wée are thus reconciled vnto him, wée may not onely reioyce with an earthly ioy, but with that ioye whiche is namely promiſed in the holy Ghoſte, to the ende wée might looke for the ſame in him.</p>
            <p>Nowe, peace and ioy are thinges whiche cannot bee ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated: For howe can it bée that we ſhould haue any thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to ioy, when as wée ſée our ſelues compaſſed about with ſo many miſeries. And beſides, when wée ſée our ſelues curſed in <hi>Adam,</hi> The children of wrath, and God being our iudge, armed to execute vengeance to the throwing of vs downe into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſſe depth, what ioy is it poſſible for vs to conceiue, who ſtande in ſuche a deſperate eſtate? And ſurely when wée thinke héereon, It cannot bée that wée ſhoulde bée onely tormented with
<pb facs="tcp:7663:24"/> vnquiet mindes, but alſo bée oppreſſed with the horrour of Hell fier, which ſurpaſſeth all the griefes of this worlde: except ſurely the Diuell hath bewitched vs: as many wée ſée which ceaſſe not héerein to make themſelues mery, although they bée at open defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance euen with God himſelfe. But if wee had but one droppe of féeling within vs, without doubt wée ſhoulde alwaies liue in torment, vntyll ſuch time as wée finde God to ſhewe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe mercifull vnto vs. And therefore this peace muſt goe before, that wée are fully aſſured that God alloweth vs for his children and that becauſe hee imputeth not our ſinnes vnto vs. Nowe, are wée in this ſorte at peace with God? And if wée bée ſo, then ſurely wée haue wherefore to reioyce: yea euen with God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which I haue alreadie touched. For the very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelles haue a certaine kinde of peace (that is to ſay, They are ſo ſenſles, as that they make no reckoning of the iudgement of God yea they are euen angrie with him) but it is not with God. For they neuer are at peace and reſt, without it bée when they forget both God, &amp; themſelues, &amp; become altogether brutiſh, howbeit S. Paul exhorteth vs to be at peace with God:<note place="margin">Rom. <hi>5.</hi>2.</note> that is to ſay, to looke vnto him &amp; ſearch how wée may be at peace, that is, wee drawing néere vnto him, are certaine &amp; ſure of his loue, But how ſhal this bée doone? forſooth euen by the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, through the loue which hée beareth vs in our Lord Ieſus Chriſte. Let vs héere now note, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the peace which the Angels of heauen preached at this time, brought this ioy, whereof the firſt Angel made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſaying, Beholde, I bring you tydinges of great ioy, that is, The ſaluation which you haue in Ieſus Chriſt. For hée is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led our peace: and this title declareth vnto vs, that wée ſhould bée altogether ſeparated from God, without he receiued vs, by the meanes of his onely ſonne.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, héereon wée haue alſo wherfore to glory, when God alloweth vs for his children, and giueth vs leaue to claime him with open mouth as our father, to come fréely vnto him, and in him to haue our refuge Let vs héerevpon gather by the way, that God hath ſo appointed his Goſpell to bée preached by the mouth of men, as yet notwithſtanding the Angelles haue gone before them and leade them the way. True it is, that at this day the Churche muſt bée taught by the meane of mortall creatures
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7663:24"/> But howe euer it is, this is no ſtraunge thing that wee bring, but doe onely recite the preaching of the Angelles of heauen: and that of no ſmale number neither, but of an infinite multitude, and of an huge armie.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, wée cannot but néedes bée inflamed to magnifie our God, whenas wée are throughly certified of his goodneſſe. Sée nowe why theſe two things are ioyned together, that the Angels exhort all the worlde to glorifie GOD, it is becauſe hée gaue ſuche a peace vppon the earth, wee inioy therefore the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite which God hath largely beſtowed vpon vs by the meane of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte his onely ſonne. And hée hath taken the poſſeſſion of this peace, to the ende our prayſes might bée heard to the heauens, &amp; pearſe the cloudes and that all the world might reſound this ſonge. The Lorde bée bleſſed and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for euer. Héerevpon wée are to gather, that our mouthes muſt alwaies bée ſtopped, and that wée can neuer praiſe God, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuche time as hée hath cauſed vs to féele his great goodneſſe. For to ſay truely, how is it poſſible for miſerable ſinners to bleſſe and magnifie the name of God, ſo long as they haue that trouble of conſcience, that they knowe not whether God loueth or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them? But contrariwiſe, their mouthes, by reaſon of their griefes, muſt néedes be faſt cloſed vp, ſo that they are not once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to open their lippes. And therefore muſte GOD let vs ſo vnderſtande in very good earneſt the loue hee beareth vs, as that wee may bée fully aſſured, that hee is alwaies our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and then ſhall wee haue wherefore to bleſſe his name.</p>
            <p>But as wée cannot poſſibly, in trueth praiſe God, vntill ſuch time as hee hath declared vnto vs his bountie, euen ſo let vs alſo learne not to haue a dead and idle faith: but when wée ſée that he hath bountifully beſtowed vpon vs the great treaſures of his mercie: let our mouth then doe his office in ſtirryng vp it ſelfe to bleſſe his name, and let our whole life alſo anſwere the ſame. For this is the very right ſigne, Euery of vs muſt conſcecrate himſelf to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true ſeruice &amp; worſhip of God, becauſe we knowing, that hée hath ſo dearely bought vs, ought by good reaſon to beſtow all our thoughts &amp; déedes in the bleſſing &amp; magnifying of his moſt holy &amp; glorious name. And that when we acknowledge ourſelues
<pb facs="tcp:7663:25"/> to bée in very déede his, wée might vnderſtande that it procéedeth of his frée mercy and goodneſſe, that it hath ſo pleaſed him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept vs vnto himſelfe. And therefore this ſaying is not ſet downe without cauſe, That <hi>peace</hi> is graunted to men: not for any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, or for that wée haue purchaſed the ſame, but becauſe it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God. For the ſpéeche, which Saint Luke vſeth, importeth this much, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wée muſt ſéek after none other reaſon why our Lord Ieſus Chriſte appeared to vs: but becauſe that God had compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our miſeries: as it is alſo ſaide in Iohn, That God ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the worlde,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3.16.</note> as that hée ſpared not to deliuer his onely begotten Sonne to death for vs. And therefore let vs after this manner come vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte: to wit, that the meſſage which is héere publiſhed vnto vs by the Angels, might bée a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Lanterne to ſhew vs the way, &amp; faith to bée our guide, ſo that wée might vnderſtande that hée is nowe God in vs, becauſe he is God with vs. For (as I haue alreadie ſaide) hée is declared to bée our God with vs, when as hée meant to dwell in our humane nature, as in his temple: But hée is nowe God in vs. That is to ſay, wée féele him conioyned to vs in farre greater power, then when hée ſhewed and declared himſelfe a mortal man. Yea, for he is nowe both God and man in vs. For, firſt hée quickneth vs by the power of his holy ſpirite: and hée is beſides, man in vs, becauſe hée maketh vs pertakers of the Sacrifice which hée offered vp for our ſaluation: and declareth vnto vs that it was not without cauſe that hee ſaide, that his fleſhe was meate indéede, and his blood, drinke in déede. And therefore wée ſée why the holy Table is made ready for vs, to wit, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end that wée knowing our Lord Ieſus to bée deſcended héere belowe,<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.35.</note> and vtterly abaſed, yet that hée is not for all that ſeparated from vs, although hée bée aſcended into the heauens in glory and maieſtie. But rather vpon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that wée might bée partakers of his body and blood. And why ſo? For wée knowe that his righteouſneſſe and obedience was the ſatiſfaction for our ſinnes, and hath appeaſed the wrath of God, through the Sacrifice whiche hée offered of his body and blood in the ſame humane nature which hée tooke vpon vs. Since the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is ſo, let not vs doubt when Ieſus Chriſt biddeth vs to this Table, although wee can perceiue nothing els but bread &amp; wine, but that hee verily dwelleth in vs, and wee ſo ſurely knit vnto
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7663:25"/> him, that there is nothing which is his, but hée will communicate the ſame to vs. Let vs therefore (I ſay) acknowledge this, to the end we might know to make our profit of this Sacrament which he himſelfe hath eſtabliſhed: and let vs vnderſtande, that ſo often as wée receiue the ſame, that hée might verie well haue deliuered vs by ſome other meane from the bottomeleſſe pitte of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, wherein wée were if it had pleaſed him: but that his meaning was to graunte vs more aſſurance of the loue hée beare vs, when as we haue Ieſus Chriſt for a pawne, becauſe we might ſéeke after our ſaluation in him: and acknowledge that wée are no manner of way whatſoeuer, able to reioyce, vntill ſuche time as hée bée geuen vs as it were amongeſt vs, and bée ſo néere vs, as that by his meanes wée might bée brought to the kingdome of heauen, whereof wée were depriued by reaſon of our ſinnes. And thus wée ſée that Ieſus Chriſt muſt bée the ready way for our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, if euer wée intend to come vnto God, &amp; deſire to haue a true ſpirituall ioy, and a ſpirituall contentation and quietneſſe: and if wee alſo deſire to bee armed againſt all the temptations, wherewith Satan is able to attempt vs. But and if wée will be partakers of this holie table, let vs conſider wel with our ſelues, &amp; in the firſt place acknowledge our miſeries, and be diſpleaſed, and vtterly aſhamed of them. Moreouer, let vs acknowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that God meant to aſſwage all our ſorowes &amp; griefes, when as hée ſo liberally ſhewed himſelfe in his onelye begotten Sonne, and would haue vs fully and wholy ioye in him. And although we be ſubiect to many miſeries in this world, and are beſieged with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies like vnto rauening woolues, ſo that the deuill ceaſeth not to make a pray of vs, and the Infidelles barke at vs like maſtyfe curres: although (I ſay) wée be on euery ſide troubled and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tned: and although we muſt abyde many griefes:<note place="margin">Philip. 4.7.</note> yet let vs hold this for a moſt ſure ground, that wée ſhall haue alwayes peace in our God: and let vs beſéech him, that he will make vs féele it by his holy ſpirite, becauſe it is a thing that ſurpaſſeth all mans rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (as we haue already touched of S. Paule) and learne to bée ſo contented with our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and with the ſpirituall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites wherof we are pertakers, as that we may patiently abide all the afflictions and miſeries of this worlde. And beſides, let vs
<pb facs="tcp:7663:26"/> beſéeche him that wée take it not in euill parte to bée contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and on euery ſide troubled, to bée ſhort, to bee put too all reproche and ſhame, ſo that Ieſus Chriſte bée with vs, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all our myſeries and afflictions, and that wée bryng foorth ſuche fruite thereby, as that it may bee knowne, that in the middeſt of all our miſeries wée deſire nothing els but the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiyng of our GOD. And where the worldlinges triumphe to their ſhame and confuſion, becauſe all their ioy is too ſtriue againſt GOD, Let our true ioy bée too ſerue him in all feare and humilitie, and yeelde our ſelues wholy to his obedience. And héere wée ſée the way by which wée muſt make our profite vpon this doctrine.</p>
            <p>Let vs nowe fall downe before the Maieſtie of our good GOD, and acknowledge our faultes, beſéechyng hym too make vs more and more to féele them: that héereby we may learne to ſubmit our ſelues vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte: knowyng that if wee bée ſeparated from him, all our whole life, and whatſoeuer benefites els wee receiue from GOD, ſhall turne to our moſt gréeuous condemnation. And that wée maye féele his death and paſſion to bée communicated vnto vs, and bee taken for the members of his body, to the ende the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions whiche wée ſhall abide héere in this worlde, may be ſo many helpes and furtherances vnto ſaluation. So that wée may all ſaye, O moſte Mightie GOD, and Heauenlie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. &amp;c.</p>

The one is, That wée might know the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable loue, which GOD beareth vs, to the end wée might glorifie him therfore, as he is worthy. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, That wée ſhould abhorre our ſinnes, as we ought, and to bée truely aſhamed to humble our ſelues before the Maieſtie of our GOD. The thirde, that wée might in ſuch ſorte eſtéeme of our ſaluation, as that it might make vs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the worlde, and whatſoeuer thinge elſe belongeth vnto this tranſitorie lyfe, and to bée in loue with this enheritaunce, which was ſo déerely purchaſed for vs.</p>
               <p>And héere we ſée whereon we muſt caſt our eies, and beſtow all our ſenſes, when it is told vs, that the Sonne of GOD hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déemed vs from euerlaſting death, and purchaſed for vs euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting lyfe. Wée muſt therefore in the firſt place learne,
<pb facs="tcp:7663:27"/> to render vnto God the prayſe due vnto him. Now, to ſay truely, he might, if hée had pleaſed) haue deliuered vs from the bottome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe depthes of death after an other ſorte: But his good will was, largely to beſtow and powre vpon vs the treaſures of his infinite goodneſſe, when as hée ſpared not his onely ſonne. And our Lord Ieſus would héerein giue vs an excellent pawne of his wonderful care towardes vs, when as he offred himſelfe willingly to death. For we ſhal neuer bée touched to the quick, nor enflamed to praiſe our God, without we on the other ſide doe examine our eſtate, and be as it were throwne downe into the bottomleſſe pit of hell, kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing what a thing it is to haue prouoke his wrath, and to becom our mortall enimie, hauing him as a terrible and fearefull Iudge: ſo that it were a great deale better, that heauen and earth, and all the creatures had conſpyred againſt vs, then that wée ſhoulde once come néere his Maieſtie, ſo long as he is againſt vs. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is very méete that ſinners ſhould be wounded with the fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and conceiuing of their ſinnes, that they might know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to bée moſt miſerable, and feare their eſtate, to the end they might thereby knowe how greatly they are beholden and bounde vnto God, in that he hath compaſſion vpon them, and ſéeing them in a deſperate caſe, hath very good will to helpe them, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of any their worthineſſe, but onlie for their myſeries ſake. And ſo alſo is it (as we haue already ſaide) becauſe we are too too much intangled here below, and when as God calleth vs vnto him, our mindes and affections, ſo kéepe vs backe, as that we had néed to make much of the heauenly life, as it is woorthy, and knowe with how déere a price it was purchaſed for vs. And héere wée ſée why it is told vs, that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt did not only meane to ſuffer death, and offered himſelfe a Sacrifice to appeaſe the the wrath of God his Father, but alſo, to the ende, that hée might truely and indéede be our pledge, he refuſed not to abide the angui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes and griefes, which were prepared for all ſuch as in conſcience are touched, and féele themſelues guiltie of euerlaſting death and condemnation before God. Let vs then heare rightly note that the Sonne of God, was not contented to offer vp his fleſhe and blood and yéeld himſelfe vnto death, but would withall, appeare before the iudgement ſeate of GOD, in the name and perſon of all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ready, there to be condemned: and that becauſe he beare our
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7663:27"/> burden. And therefore we muſt not be aſhamed, ſéeing the ſonne of God hath ſubmitted him ſelfe to ſuch an infirmitie. Neither was it without cauſe that Saint Paule exhorteth vs, not to be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the preaching of the Croſſe, albeit it be to ſome fooliſhneſſe, and an offence to many. For, the more that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was humbled, we ſée thereby that the offences for the which wée were in arrerages and behinde with God, could not be aboliſhed, without great extremitie. And in déed, we know that he was made weake, that wée might be made ſtrong by his power, and beſides, hée would abide all our ſufferinges, ſinne excepted, to the ende hée might be readie at this day to helpe vs. For if hée had not felte in his owne perſon the feares, doubtes, and torments, which we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, he would not be ſo enclined to be mercifull vnto vs as hée is. Wée ſay, that he who knoweth not what hunger and thirſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, will neuer be ſtirred vp to haue compaſſion vpon thoſe that féele it, becauſe they haue alwayes taken their eaſe, and liued in pleaſure. Now it is true, that although God in his owne nature ſuffereth not any of our paſſions, yet ceaſeth hée not for all that to be curteous vnto vs: but that is becauſe hée is the fountayne of all goodneſſe and mercy. Neuertheleſſe, to the end we might be aſſured that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt knoweth our weaknes to help it, &amp; that we might come the boldlier vnto him, &amp; haue a more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar acceſſe. The apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Hebr. 2.10.</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would for the ſame cauſe be te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted euen as we are. So then, we haue to obſerue in this text which we haue read, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Lord Ieſus was come into this village of <hi>Gethſamene,</hi> &amp; namely, into the Mount <hi>Oliuet,</hi> it was to offer him ſelf willingly to death. And herein, his will was to be diſcharged of the office &amp; charge that was committed vnto him. For why cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed he him ſelf with our fleſh &amp; nature, without it were to repaire all our rebellions through his obedience, to the end to purchaſe vs full &amp; perfect righteouſnes before God his Father? And therefore offered he him ſelf to death, becauſe we might not be reconciled by any other meane, neither yet appeaſe the wrath of God, prouoked by ſin, but by this onely obedience. Thus we ſée why the Sonne of God came fréely vnto the place, where he knew that Iudas ſhould finde him. And let vs knowe that it ſo fell out, becauſe our father Adam through his tranſgreſſion, had throwne vs all downe head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bottomleſſe depth, that the ſonne of God who had power
<pb facs="tcp:7663:28"/> ouer all creatures, might be ſubiect, and take vpon him the ſtate of a ſeruant: as he is likewiſe called the ſeruant of God, &amp; of all his. Sée alſo why S. Paul,<note place="margin">Iſaiah. <hi>42.</hi>1.</note> in ſhewing vs how we muſt ſtay our ſelues when we call vpon God with full aſſurance, &amp; be heard as his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſaith that we are reputed righteous through the obedience of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">Rom. 5.19.</note> For this is as it were a cloake to couer all our ſinnes &amp; offences: ſo that the thing that might hinder vs for the obteining of grace, might not come into a reckoning before God. But we on the contrary part ſée, that the price of our redemption coſt very deare, when as our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was ſo tormented that hee aboad the very terror &amp; feare of death: inſomuch that hée ſweat droppes of blood, &amp; was as it were lyke one beſides himſelfe, deſiring if it were poſſible that hée might eſcape that diſtreſſe. And therfore ſince we ſée it to be thus, it is good for vs to come to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of our ſinnes. For, it is no time for vs to rocke our ſelues here a ſléepe through flattery, when wee ſée the Sonne of God plunged in this extremitie, as though he were in the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe depthes. Nowe if this onely came to paſſe vnto a iuſt man, then ought we to be touched, inſomuch as it fell out that a poore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent ſuffered for our raunſome, which thing came to paſſe to the Sonne of God. But beholde howe the fountayne of life, hath ſubmitted him ſelfe vnto death: and hee which vpholdeth all the worlde by his power, is now become weake: and hée who hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered the creatures from all feare, hath ſuſteined ſo wonderfull horror. Wherfore, when this is told vs, it can not be but that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of vs muſt néedes be moſt blockiſh, if we enter not euerie man-into him ſelfe, and being touched with his faultes and iniquities, is not aſhamed before God, and ſo ſigh and grone: and namely, by this meane to be brought vnto God with true repentaunce. Nowe it is impoſſible for vs, rightly to conuert vnto God, without wée condemne our ſelues, and conceiue both the very terror and griefe of the curſe which is prepared for vs, vntill ſuch time, as wée bée brought againe into fauour with God. But becauſe we may the better conceiue of the whole matter, it is ſaid, that our Lord Ieſus tooke onely thrée of his Diſciples, &amp; left the reſt of the company a good way of: neither had he them through with him, but prayde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God his father ſecretly. Wherfore, when we ſée this, we are to note, that our Lord Ieſus had no companion when he offered him
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7663:28"/> ſelfe an oblation for vs: But finiſhed whatſoeuer was requiſit for our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And namely, it is yet better declared vnto vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the Diſciples ſlept, &amp; could not be keptwake, although they had bin ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times before warned, that the houre drew neare wherin our Lord Ieſus muſt ſuffer for the redemption of mankinde, &amp; had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them by the ſpace of thrée houres, declaring vnto them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually without ceaſing, that his death approched. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding all this, they ſlept ſtil. Wherein is ſhewed vnto vs, as in a liuely picture, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was méet that the ſonne of God ſhould take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him all our burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: neither was it fit that he ſhould looke for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And it was to none other end, but that we ſhould take vp our ſelues for ſtraying, as we ſée the miſerable Infidels doe, who can not be contented to ſtay them ſelues vpon our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, but imagine that they muſt haue Patrons, &amp; Aduocats, as if there were many Redéemers. For we ſée namely, the blaſphemies which reigne in that curſed papacy, that the merits of Saints muſt ſerue to helpe the death and paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that by the ſame we might be freed &amp; diſcharged towardes God For although (ſay they) there was a generall forgiueneſſe for the fault of origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne, and of actual ſinnes, yet muſt they be mingled together: and the blood of Ieſus Chriſt is not ſufficient except the Martyres, had ouer and beſides, merited: and therfore we muſt alſo haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe thether, to the end God might be mercifull vnto vs. Nowe, when the Deuil hath after this maner ouerune the whole world, ſo much the more ought we to beware, that we holde vs faſt vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; knowe that it is in him alone y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we muſt finde all perfection of ſaluation. And ſée why it is namely ſaide in the Prophet Iſaiah, That God wondred,<note place="margin">Iſaiah. 63.5.</note> when hee ſée that there was none on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other ſide to vphold. It is verie true that God right well knew, that he alone muſt make our ſaluation perfect: But it was to the ende that wée might be aſhamed, and not bée deceiued with hypocriſie, as if wée brought nothing with vs for the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, &amp; for the cauſe of God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs into his loue and fauour: ſo that, we might not runne hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; thither to finde out Mediators. And therefore, for the cutting off, of all this geare, it is ſaide that God holpe him ſelfe with his owne arme, and ended all by his iuſtice, without any compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Nowe this is declared vnto vs euen as it were before
<pb facs="tcp:7663:29"/> our eyes, when it is ſaid, that thrée of the chiefe of all the Diſciples, ſlept like miſerable beaſtes: in whom was nothing els but beaſtly blockiſhneſſe: which thing was as it were a Monſter againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. to ſée them ſléepe in ſuch extremity. And to the end we might withdraw our confidence from all Creatures, and ſhut it wholly vp in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, ſée why it is ſayde, That hée wente forwarde to the combate. Moreouer, in that he went to God his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hée ſheweth vs the remedy for the eaſing of all our griefes, for the mytigating of our ſorowes, and euen for the rayſing of our ſelues vp agayne, when as wée ſhall bée as it were cleane throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en downe. For if wée bée grieued and vexed, wée knowe that God is not in vayne named the Father of Conſolation.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2.3.</note> Againe, if wée bée ſeparated from him, where muſt wée finde power and ſtrength but in him? But by the way, wée ſée that hée woulde in no wiſe let his buſineſſe be vndone. Let vs then héere beholde the Sonne of GOD, who, when wée are in ſorow and anguiſhe guideth vs by his exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple vnto the true refuge, But let vs alſo note what forme of prayer hée vſeth, <hi>O my Father, if it bee posſible, Let this cup paſſe from mee,</hi> or this drinke: For this is ſpoken by way of ſimilitude, when hée ſpeaketh of a Cruſe, Glaſſe, or a Cuppe? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Scripture calleth afflictions, bytter drinkes, to the ende wée might knowe that nothing commeth by chaunce: But that God as an Houſholder diſtributeth to euery man as pleaſeth him. For like as a Father will geue vnto euery of his children his portion, or a Maiſter to his ſeruantes, Euen ſo doeth God ſhewe that hee ſcourgeth and afflicteth them with his owne hand: And likewiſe when we haue any benefits, it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth of his frée goodnes, and geueth vs as much of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as hee thinketh to be good for vs. And after this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon maner it is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our Lord Ieſus ſaith that death is to him ſo bitter drink, &amp; would gladly haue it to paſſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, yea <hi>If it were posſible,</hi> In very déed, about this, might many queſtions be moued: For it ſhould ſéeme at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt ſight, that Ieſus Chriſt had forgoten our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or rather in flying fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> light, ment to leaue vs in deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feare that he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued. Now, this wil neuer agrée w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which we haue ſaid: &amp; eſpecially, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue which he hath ſhewed vs ſhould be greatly darkened. But we néed not to enter into ſuch ſubtill diſputations: Bicauſe we know that a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times ſo taketh away y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind of a man, as that he thinketh
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7663:29"/> not either of one thing or of an other: But béeing vexed with the preſent griefe, he there caſteth himſelfe, without hauing any other regard for the vpholding of himſelfe. Wherefore, when our minds are thus rauiſhed, we cannot ſay that the reſt is cleane blotted out of our heartes, and that wee haue no affection. As for example, A man that conſidereth of ſome affliction of the Churche, namely, of a particular affliction, hée will pray vnto GOD as if the reſt of the worlde were nothing to him. Nowe, is it therefore for vs to ſay, that this is an vnkinde man, and hath no care of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who haue as great néde alſo to be prayed for? No: But it is becauſe that this affection hath taken ſuche a mightie poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion in him, as that the reſte of his affection, is as it were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated for a time. Wée reade, that Moſes prayed to bee blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the Booke of life: Nowe, if wée woulde cull the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the leſſe,<note place="margin">Exod. 32.32.</note> wée woulde ſay that Moſes blaſphemed againſt GOD, becauſe hée ſpake, as if GOD had béene chaungea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For they whom GOD hath ordayned to euerlaſting life, can neuer periſhe: And therefore it ſéemeth that Moſes ſtriueth héere with GOD, and that hée will doe as wée doe, who chaunge our councell and determinations. And beſides, howe honoured hée GOD when as hée knewe himſelfe to bée of the number of the choſen, and knew that God had marked him euen from his childehood to commit ſo notable a charge vnto him, as to bée the Leader of his people, and yet deſired to bée razed and cut of from GOD? And whither then was this gone? nowe, a man might make many argumentes: But the ſolution is eaſie, For Moſes hauing ſo feruent a zeale for the ſaluation of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſéeyng beſides, the horrible threat which God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by his owne mouth, forgotte himſelfe for a minute of time, and deſired nothing els but the helpe of the people.</p>
               <p>Let vs then ſée howe our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte behaued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. For if it was méete that hée ſhoulde ſuffer an hundreth deathes, yea a Myllion, without doubte hée was prepared for that purpoſe before: Howebeit, ſuche was his will, not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but for vs, to abide the anguiſhes whiche plunged him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it as wée ſée. And thus much for this poynt. Nowe for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde, If it bée aſked, howe our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, who is ſaide to bée altogether righteous, the Lambe without ſpotte, and the
<pb facs="tcp:7663:30"/> verie rule and glaſſe of all righteouſneſſe, holineſſe, and perfection, could will, contrarie to God his will. This is the anſwere, that God is the whole perfection of righteouſneſſe and iudgement. For although the Angels are conformable to the will of God, and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obedient vnto him, yet is their will ſeparate: For, becauſe they are creatures, they may haue affections which apperteine not to God. But as for vs who are compaſſed about with this lump of ſinne, we are ſo blockiſh as that we are verie farre from the will of God: for our deſires excéede, yea and are oftentimes verie mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly Rebellious. But if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider of man as he was in his pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to wit, without this corruption of ſinne, yet without doubt his affections ſhall come nothing nigh vnto Gods, and yet not bée corrupt. As if Adam were not thus peruerted as hée is, but had continued in the ſame eſtate, wherein hée was created, yet had hee abidden heate and cold, and might haue ſuffered cares, and feares, and ſuch other like. And ſuch a one we ſée was our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. For we know that his affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were without ſpot or blot, and they all were ſquared vnto the obedience of God, but yet (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hée had taken our nature vpon him) hée was ſubiect to feare and to this terror wherof we euen now ſpake, and vnto cares and ſuch like. We cannot ſée this in vs, no more then in pudly wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a man can iudge of anything. And thus we ſée how theſe earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affections cauſe vs to flote from one ſide to an other, and ſo toſſe vs, as that God had néede to vpholde vs: But the affections which we that are deſcended of Adam haue, are like vnto clay excéedingly tempered with infection, ſo that we cannot ſée what this paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was, if we meaſure it as we are men. For when we do any thing to a good end, &amp; our affection of it ſelf is iuſt, and allowed of God, yet ſhall we continually fayle therein. For is not this a good and holie thing, for a father to loue his chilren? And yet for all that, this is ſinne in vs: becauſe there is not that order and moderation that is required in the ſame: for amongeſt all the vertues which wée may haue, GOD maketh vs to ſée that there are vices in them, to the ende our pryde might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bée abated, and wée might alwayes haue occaſion to caſte downe our heades, and bée aſhamed, ſéeing our verie goodneſſe is corrupted through ſinne which dwelleth in vs, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7663:30"/> wée are filled, and full fraught.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, as for our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt (as I haue alreadie ſaid) it is not for vs to meruel (foraſmuch as he was ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) although his will differed from the will of God his Father: But yet wée muſt not hereby iudge that there was any ſinne and tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in him. And (as wée haue before ſaide) wée héerein eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſée, the ineſtimable loue hée beare vs, whenas hée ſo great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feared death, that yet of his owne good will hée ſubmitted him ſelfe thereto. And beſides, when as hée neither withſtood it, nor yet gaineſaide the ſupping vp of this drinke wherein hée felt no bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe, what a thing was this for vs to bée in this manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déemed? Howbeit this might ſéeme to bée a merry ieſt: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, when it ſo fell out that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured ſuche anguiſhes, it was a ſigne that hée ſo loued vs, as that hée forgot him ſelfe, and ſuffered the whole tempeſt to light vpon his owne head, that wée might bée deliuered from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrath of God. Now, there remaineth for vs to note, when the Sonne of God was after this manner tormented, that it was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hée was to depart out of this lyfe: For if there had béene none other thing but the ſeparation of the ſoule, from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, together, with the tormentes which hée was to ſuffer in his bodie, this had béen no ſuch affliction.</p>
               <p>But let vs conſider of the qualitie of his death: and let vs chiefly come to the originall thereof. For death did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſſolue the man, but made him alſo to féele the curſe of God. For ouer and beſides that, that God taketh vs out of his world, and that wée leaue this preſent lyfe, Death is vnto vs an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traunce as it were into the gulfe of hell. And therefore, when wee heare death ſpoken of, wée muſt néedes bee ſeparated from GOD, and cut off from all hope of ſaluation, without wee had this remedie, to wyt, that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt hath ſuffered for vs, to the ende that the wounde which came by reaſon of it, might bee no more deadly. For without him, we were ſo wounded by death, that there was no more hope of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation for vs: but now the ſting therof is broken: yea the poyſon therof is ſo cle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed &amp; wiped away, that we being humbled by death,
<pb facs="tcp:7663:31"/> it ſerueth vs at this day for a medicine, and is no more deadly, becauſe Ieſus Chriſte hath ſwallowed vpp all the curſe which was in it. Nowe let vs ſée what it is, that wée haue too kéepe in mynde, whiche is, that ſonne of God in crying out, <hi>O my Father, if it be poſſible, let this drinke be taken from me,</hi> did not regard on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the ſuffringes in his bodie, neither the ſhame of men, nor yet the leauing of the worlde: (for he could eaſily abide all theſe things) But hée reſpected his comming before God, and before his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeate, to make an account for all our ſinnes, and to behold al the curſes of God which were prepared. For when as there was but one only ſinner, what was this to the wrath of GOD? And when it is ſaid that God is againſt vs, &amp; wil diſplay his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to confound vs, Alas, what ſhall become of vs? Now, it hath ſo fallen out, that Ieſus Chriſt did not onely ſtriue againſt ſuche a feare, but againſt all the cruelties that might bee heaped vp toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And therefore when wée ſée GOD call to a reckoning all thoſe who haue deſerued euerlaſting condemnation, and are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ſinne, and that hée himſelfe is there to pronounce ſuche ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence as they haue deſerued, who will not conceyue all the deathes, doubtes, and terrors, which may bée in euery one. And then what a deſtruction will there bée in this? Nowe, it hath fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len out that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte himſelfe alone without anie helpe, hath borne ſuch a burden.</p>
               <p>Let vs therfore iuſtly weight y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſorow of the Sonne of God, &amp; therevpon, let vs returne to the thing which wee haue already touched which is, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> on the one ſide we might knowe how déere our ſaluation, &amp; how precious our ſoules were vnto him, when as hée woulde bring himſelfe into ſo great extremitie for our ſakes: and in acknowledging that that wee haue deſerued, Let vs ſée what our eſtate had béene, if hée had not holpen vs. And in the meane while, let vs reioyce, when as wée ſée death to haue no more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ouer vs that may hurt vs. In verie déede, wée ſhoulde naturally alwayes feare Death, and flie it: But it is to this ende, that wee ſhould thinke vpon that ineſtimable benefite whiche the Sonne of God hath purchaſed by his death: &amp; alwaies conſider, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it commeth through death it ſelfe, which death importeth the wrath of God, &amp; which wrath is as it were the gulfe of hell.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when we are to fight againſt this feare, we might
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7663:31"/> know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath ſo prouided for al theſe feares, as that wee might euen in the middeſt of death it ſelfe, come with bolde countenance before our God. True it is, that wée ſhoulde before all thinges humble our ſelues, and muſt as we haue before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaide, bée touched with the iudgement of God, and with the terror thereof, if wée intend to hate our ſinnes, and bée diſpleaſed with them: howbeit in the meane while when God calleth vs vnto him, wée muſt then come with chéerefull countenance. And ſee alſo what boldneſſe is graunted to all the faithfull:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8.</note> for Saint Paule ſaith, That our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte hath prepared a crowne for all thoſe which looke for his comming. Wherefore, if we hope not for life in comming before the heauenly Iudge, without doubt hée will refuſe vs, and not know vs, neither will hee allowe of vs, although wée profeſſe our ſelues to bée Chriſtians. And ſurely we cannot waite for our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt without we bée reſolued and perſwaded that he hath ſo fought againſt the feares of death, that wée are thereby made free, and that hée obteined victory for vs. And although wée are to fight, to the ende wée might féele our infirmities, and thereby haue recourſe vnto God, which might continually draw vs to a true confeſſion of our ſinnes, ſo that God himſelfe might bée declared to him alone to bee iuſt: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding let vs aſſure our ſelues that Ieſus Chriſte hath ſo fought as that he hath got the victorie, not onely for himſelf, but for vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: And neuer doubt but that by this meanes we may now ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all cares, feares, and terrors, and call vpon God, ſéeing wée are aſſured that he continually ſtretcheth foorth his armes to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace vs. And héere we ſée, what we muſt obſerue, which is, we muſt know that this is no ſpeculatiue doctrine, when it is ſaide, That our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt hath abiden the horrible feares of death, becauſe he felt that he was before our iudge as our pledge, to the end that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of that combate we might get aduantage ouer our infirmities, &amp; conſtantly abide in calling vpon the name of God, doubting but that hée will heare vs, and bée continually ready, of his goodneſſe to receiue vs, vnto himſelfe: ſo that by that meanes we ſhall paſſe both through life and death, fier, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and ſo might all féele, that our Lorde Ieſus hath not fought in v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ine for the obteining of ſuch a victory, for all ſuch as come vnto him in faith. Héere then wée ſee in ſumme, what it is
<pb facs="tcp:7663:32"/> that wée muſt remember. But yet by the way wee ſée that wée muſt fight againſt our affections, and without wée ſo doe, it is impoſſible for vs to remoue our finger, but that wee ſhall eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoones prouoke the wrath of GOD. For beholde our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte who was both pure and ſounde, as wée haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy declared: But if any man aſke what his will was, it was in very déed the weake will of a man: but yet no ſinfull will, as the will of thoſe who were corrupted in Adam: for there was not one ſpot of ſinne in him. Loe héere a man voide of all ſinne: But howeuer it was, yet muſt he in the ende, ſtriue and indeuour to forſake himſelfe, and caſt all this vnder his féete, that hee might yeeld his obedience vnto his father. And nowe let vs ſee what ſhall become of vs, what are our affections and thoughtes?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7.</note> Euen ſo many enimies (ſaith Saint Paule) as fight againſt God. Wée ſee heere, that God ſaith that we are altogether wayward, &amp; that whatſoeuer the mind of man deuiſeth, is nothing els but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and vanitie: yea we ſhew our ſelues, euen from our childhood to be ſeaſoned with the whole infection of ſinne. For the very yong children who come into the worlde, and whoſe wickedneſſe appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not, are notwithſtanding young ſerpents full of the poyſon of malice and diſdaine. And héere wée ſée what our nature is euen from the beginning what then will wee be (I beſéeche you) when wée come to ryper yéres? Surely (as I haue already ſaide) we are ſo very wicked, as that we cannot thinke one only thought, which ſhal not be very many rebellions againſt God: inſomuch, that we ſhall neuer be able to giue our ſelues either to one thing or other, but that we ſhall ſwarue from the right rule, yea, and ſpurne as it were diſpituouſly againſt his Maieſtie. And therefore what conflict is it that wée can ſet in order to doe any good? For when we ſée that our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, in whom was nothing but pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and righteouſneſſe, was not able to ſubmit himſelf vnto God his father, without he had denied himſelfe, is it not to bee doubted that we are any way able throughly to performe it. Let vs then learne to fight more couragiouſly: But becauſe we ſee we cannot and that all our ſtrength and power bendeth it ſelfe rather to doe euill, and not one droppe of goodneſſe in our nature, but ſo weake as that wée ſhoulde be ouercome an hundred times euery minute
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7663:32"/> of an houre, let vs come to him that was made weake, that wée might (as S. Paule ſaieth) be filled with his power. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte hath thus denied him ſelfe, let vs learne, if wée will bée his Diſciples to doe the like. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wée ſée that wée cannot of our ſelues attaine thereto, but goe altogether backewarde, let vs beſéeche him,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4.</note> that hée woulde by the power of his holy ſpirite haue dominion in vs to ſtrengthen vs, as it is ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hée ſuffered in the infirmitie of his fleſhe, but was raiſed vp againe through the power of the ſpirite, that we might bée partakers of the afliction which hée ſuſteined, and féele the fruit and excellencie of his power in vs. Heere nowe wée ſée in effect what it is that wée muſt beare in minde, when it is ſaide that Chriſte gaue ouer his owne will, that hee might fully and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmit himſelfe vnto God his Father. Notwithſtanding, we haue heere continually to remember, that the Sonne of GOD determined not onely to ſet foorth himſelfe héere for an example or glaſſe, but to ſhew vs how dearely our ſaluation coſt him. For the Deuill, meaning to darken the infinite grace of GOD, which hath béene ſhewed vs, hath ſaide, That Ieſus Chriſte was onely as it were a patterne of all vertue. For marke how theſe hypocriticall pratling Iacke dawes in Popery behaue them ſelues, who although they cannot ſet down what obedience is, nor yet what it is to forſake a mans ſelfe, yet they ſay, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the Euangeliſt hath written of Ieſus Chriſte is to this ende that wée ſhoulde followe him, and bée like vnto him. Now, this is ſomewhat: But yet not all, neither the principall matter For an Angell might very well haue béene ſent, to haue tolde vs that wee muſte followe him: But when Ieſus Chriſte became the redéemer of the worlde, hée of his owne good will ſubmitted himſelfe vnto this miſerable condition, as héere wée ſee. And therefore muſt wée alwayes vnderſtande, that when wée can finde nothing in our ſelues that may giue vs any hope of ſaluation, it remaineth that wée muſt ſéeke for that in him, which is wanting in vs. For wee are neuer able to obteine the grace and fauour of GOD, nor yet come néere him, without wee come as poore Beggers, vnto Ieſus Chriſte, which can neuer bee doone, vntyll ſuch time as we
<pb facs="tcp:7663:33"/> knowe our miſeries and wants: and to be ſhort, except we know vtterly our vnableneſſe, wee ſée then what it is that wee are to remember, to the end that after we haue vnderſtood, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole perfection of our life is to obey God, and to forſake our affections and thoughts, and whatſoeuer els that is in our nature which is to make vs agréeable vnto him: when wee vnderſtand this much, we muſt craue at the handes of God, that, which we haue not: And that wée might know alſo, that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt is not deliuered vnto vs for an example onely, but is eft ſoones declared vnto vs, that if we be ſeparated from him, our life muſt néedes bee accurſed, and that in death we ſée the bottomleſſe depthes of the curſe, and that gulfe of Gods wrath to ſwallowe vs quite vp, and that not onely one feare, but a million of feares haue laide faſt holde on vs, and al the creatures of God crie for vengeance on our behalfe. And therfore let vs haue this féeling, becauſe we might acknowledge our ſinnes, ſigh, and be aſhamed of our ſelues, and take boldneſſe to come vnto God with true humilitie and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Let vs likewiſe eſtéeme of the goodneſſe and mercy of our God as héere is ſhewed vs, and haue our mouthes wide open to pay vnto him the Sacrifice of thankſgiuing, and depart from the inticements of Satan, who hath pitched his nettes to holde vs ſtill in this worlde. Let vs alſo leaue our commodities and pleaſures, that wee might come vnto this heauenly inheritance, which hath béen ſo dearely purchaſed for vs, and becauſe we haue to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate the Supper of the Lorde the next Sunday, and that God, after he hath opened vnto vs the kingdom of heauen, ſetteth before vs a ſpirituall banket, let vs bée ſo much the more touched with this doctrine. And to ſay the trueth, when wée dayly eate and drinke for the refreſhing of our hungry bodies, God therein ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth vs ſufficiently that he is our father, and careth for theſe earthly bodies: inſomuch that we cannot eate one morſell of bread but that it witneſſeth vnto vs, that God is careful ouer vs. But in the Supper, is a ſpeciall reaſon: for God doth not there fill our bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, but lifteth our mindes vp into the kingdome of heauen, hee ſetteth before vs our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte his ſonne, for meate and drinke. And Ieſus Chriſte is not onely contented to receiue vs to his Table, but intendeth therewith to bee our féeder: for hee ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth vs in effect, that his fleſhe is meate in déede, and his blood
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7663:33"/> drinke indéede. Wherefore, when wée ſée our Lorde Ieſus, thus gently to bid vs vnto him, are not wée too too villanous, if we holde not our ſelues back from doing of any thing that may withdraw vs from him? And although we come but as men trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling our legges after vs, yet let vs ſtil be diſpleaſed with our ſins, that we might obey him, and ſtreine our ſelues ſo much as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to be rid of this worlde, and come to the kindgdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. And therefore let euery one conſider, to what ende the holy Supper ſerueth, For when we ſee that our Lord Ieſus calleth vs vnto it, that we might be partakers of his death and paſſion, let vs inioy the fruite which he hath obteined for vs, &amp; by that meane be fully reſolued, that God alloweth vs for his children, and with open mouth claime him for our father. Let vs alſo bring with vs a true faith, becauſe we knowe wherefore God the father ſent our Lorde Ieſus vnto vs, and is at this day a Mediator as he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes béen. And thereupon, ſet vs labour to bée ſo vnited to him, as that we may knowe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this is not onely ſpoken to euery of vs in particuler, but to euery of vs in generall. Let vs alſo liue together in mutuall and Brotherly concord, becauſe he himſelf hath ſuſtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and borne the condemnation which God his father had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt vs all. And therefore let vs bende our ſelues that way, and let euery of vs not onely come thither by himſelfe alone (as I haue already ſaid) but alſo bring his fellowes with him, and ſtirre one another vp, conſtantly to marche forward: hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes reſpect that our life is as were away which wée muſt goe through withall, and not ſtay in the middeſt thereof: but from day to day ſo profite, and alſo take paine to bring them néere, who are farre of, as that it may be our whole ioy, life glory, and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in ſuch ſorte helpe one another, vntyll the time that GOD hath fully and wholy gathered vs together vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Let vs nowe therefore fall downe before the Maieſtie of our good GOD, and acknowledge our ſinnes, beſéeching him to cauſe vs ſo to féele them, as that wee bée not onely diſpleaſed with them, but alſo that wée may bée more and more rydde and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of them, and ſo fight againſt our ſelues, as that he alone may beare rule in vs, and wée well agrée vnto his holy will. And in the meane while, let vs likewiſe beſéech him that it would pleaſe
<pb facs="tcp:7663:34"/> him to haue mercy vpon his miſerable worlde: and that as it was his will in generall, his onely ſonne ſhoulde bee a redéemer for all, &amp; his Goſpell preached to all, ſo alſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hée would not ſuffer vs at this day to bée hard hearted, &amp; flie form ſuch a benefite: But that wée might haue an eie and eare thereto, and one of vs drawe on another, vntill ſuch time as he hath brought vs to bée perfect with himſelfe. So that wée may all ſay with an humble heart, O Almightie God, and heauenly father, &amp;c.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue this morning ſéene, howe the Sonne of God was ſtrengthened by prayer for the abiding of ſo hard and dangerous a combate, as the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring before the iudgement ſeat of god his father to receiue ſentence of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation as our pledge or borrowe. For it behooued that mans weakenes ſhould be ſéene in him: and yet was this nothing at all derogatorie from his diuine Maieſtie, although hée was thus made of no reputation for our ſaluation. And wée haue héere beſides to note, that he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not onely once wherein wée ſée, that hée hath by his example, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted vs not to faint, although we are not hearde ſo ſoone as wée woulde. Wherefore they that are faint hearted, becauſe God, anſwereth them not at the firſt, ſhew that they knowe not what prayer is: For the right rule for vs to come vnto God, is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuer and continue. And therefore the chiefeſt exerciſe of our faith is prayer, Yet, faith cannot be without hope. Then there is no queſtion of it that God ſhoulde féede our homours ſo ſoone as wée haue once opened our lippes, and framed our petitions? But it is méete that hée ſhoulde delay them, and make vs oftentimes to languiſhe, that wée might know what it is to pray earneſtly, and without hypocriſie, and that wée might alſo declare that our faith is ſo eſtabliſhed vpon the worde of God, as that it brideleth, to the ende wée might paciently abide, vntill ſuch time as the fit oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie be come, wherein we ſhould be holpen. Let vs therefore marke that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt did not pray onely once, to God his father, but went alſo againe the ſecond time.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7663:35"/>
               <p>Moreouer, wée are to call to minde the thing before touched, to wit, that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath not here framed a light prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but yet was ſuch an one as if hée were determined to be quite ryd of him ſelfe: yea that hée, who is the power of God his father, and who vpholdeth the whole worlde, yet becauſe he muſt ſhewe him ſelfe a weake man, kéeping our place, and ſetled in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, hath ſhewed, that when hée went againe to pray, that hée did it not to make a ſhewe therof (as many prophane people imagine, that when Ieſus Chriſt appeared, hée ſuffered nothing) but to the ende to teach vs that wée are no way able to eſcape the hande and puniſhment of God, and his curſe, but by this meane. Nowe, it is hére declared vnto vs (as it was this morning) that our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt was put to the extremitie, becauſe that the burthen which hée had taken vpon him was not to be borne, without the inuincible power of the ſpirite of God, had holpen him. Neyther muſt wée thinke this to be any ſuperfluous kinde of ſpéech, when hée repeated theſe wordes.<note place="margin">Mat. 6.7.</note> For, that which is ſaid in the other text, That when wée pray vnto God we muſt not vſe much babble, as they doe who vſe many repetitions, thinking thereby to obteyne verie much, is not meant but that we ſhould continue in prayer: but it is ſpoken to this ende, to finde fault with the hypocriſie and ſuperſtition of thoſe who thinke (as a man would ſay) to rend the eares of God therewith, to make him beléeue, and perſuade him to doe that for them which they deſire: which folly wée haue ſéene reigne in the world. And yet euen among vs, how many are there, which vſe this kinde of ſorcerie, for although they ſay not their <hi>Aue Maria,</hi> yet when they haue ſaide their <hi>Pater Noſter,</hi> doe thinke that they haue obteined verie much, and thinke that God taketh a reckoning of all the words which they haue thus repeated in their prayer. Now, I call that, right ſorcerie: for they villainouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the prayer which our Lord Ieſus Chriſt deliuered vnto vs, wherein hée hath commaunded vs in a ſhort ſummarie, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wée ought and is lawfull for vs to craue at the handes of God. And yet this is no let, why a man who is ſore gréeued, but that he may oftentimes returne and pray vnto God: and when hee hath powred out ſome ſighes, hée may alſo begin againe. And therefore when wee goe vnto him without ambition, and for no glorious ſhewe: and beſides, think not by our ouer much babbling to haue
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7663:35"/> gotten any thing, but are driuen by an earneſt affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then is our perſeuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce right, after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> example of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Now this point is to bée marked of vs which wée haue touched, to wit, that the chiefeſt point of all our petitions is this, to haue God ſo to rule ouer vs, as that wée agrée with one accord, to ſubmit our ſelues vnto his good will. And this, I ſay, is a neceſſary point, for vs. For looke vpon our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, although all his affections, were iuſt holy, and agréeing vnto righteouſneſſe, yet becauſe hee was a naturall man, it was méete hee ſhould fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt anguiſhe, and ſorrowe, that might any way lay holde on him, and holde him captiue vnder the obedience of GOD his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And therfore how ſhall wée do, in whom is nothing els but wickedneſſe, and rebellion, and ſo corrupt, as that wee are not able to apply our mindes to nothing whatſoeuer, but that God is eft ſoones offended therewith, Since then it is ſo, let vs, when wée pray vnto GOD, ſo bridle our ſelues, as that none of vs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe our owne luſtes as wée are wonted: But let vs vnderſtand that wée ſhal haue greatly profited, whenas wée can ſubdue them, to the ende that God might haue maiſtrie ouer vs, There is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a very notable ſaying, Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>as our lord Ieſus Chriſt ſaith vnto his Diſciples, <hi>Watch, and pray, that yee enter not into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for although the ſpirite in deede bee ready, yet is the fleſhe weake.</hi> Hée then héere ſheweth that the principalleſt ſpurre to pricke vs on to call vpon God is this, That wee muſt fight, and that our enimies are at hand, and very ſtrong, &amp; we not able poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to reſiſt them, except our aide come from aboue, and that God fighteth for vs. And this wée knowe, that when a man is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of himſelfe, hée deſireth to followe altogether his pleaſures, and to ſléepe at his eaſe: for wee are not willingly carefull nor ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, except neceſſitie driueth vs thereto. Surely, it is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent thing to bée at reſt and quiet: But wee thinke wée ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bée at reſt, without wee become as it were like bruite beaſtes. And therefore it is euen ſo, as that neceſſitie muſt driue vs to bée watchfull. Wherefore it was not cauſeleſſe that our Lorde Ieſus tolde vs that wée muſt abide many allarmes. For that which hee once ſpake vnto his Diciples, apperteineth vnto vs all in generall: becauſe wée muſt all our life long, bee continually ready to abide many temptations. For the Diuell is our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
<pb facs="tcp:7663:36"/> enemie, if wée bée the members of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And therefore there will bée open warre without ende or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Let vs alſo ſée with what an enimie wée haue to deale withall: it is not with one alone, but the number of them is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the Diuell hath an excéeding number of waies to caſt vs downe into the bottome of Hell: one while hée trippeth vs openly, another while hée playeth vnder the boord, and by his craft wyll ſodenly bée vpon vs an hundred thouſande times before wee thinke on him. And if there were none other thing in it but euen the ſaying of Saint Paule,<note place="margin">Ephe. 6.<hi>12.</hi>
                  </note> it were ſufficient enough to make vs to bée carefull and to take héede, for thus hée ſaith, That our eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies are mightie which rule in the aire ouer our heads, and wee héere, lyke vnto poore wormes of the earth, créeping below. Saint Peter alſo vſeth the like reaſon,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet. 5.</hi>8.</note> and ſaith, That our enimie is like vnto a roring Lion which ſéeketh his play, and neuer reſteth. And héere wée ſée what wée are to obſerue, in that our Lord Ieſus ſaith, That wée muſt ſtande vpon our garde leaſt wee enter into temptation.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, although wée bée wakefull, and kéepe good watch, yet can wée not bée ſo frée, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Diuel will lyft him ſelf vp againſt vs, and aſſaile vs many and ſundry wayes. Neither can wee breake his blowes ſo farre of: but that before wée enter into the fight, wée had néed beware that wée be not tempted ouer head and cares, as wée ſay, And therefore let vs learne, that although the faithfull and children of God deſire to bée at reſt, yet muſt they not deſire to bée heere at theyr eaſe: but be contented to haue God to make perfect his power in their infirmitie: For Saint Paule al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſaieth that hée muſt doe the like.<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Cor. <hi>12.</hi>9.</note> And this is, ſay I, the ſtate and condition of all the children of GOD, euen to fight in this worlde, becauſe they cannot ſerue God without ſome ſtriuing. For although they bee weake, and may be letted, yea euen often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times throwne downe,<note place="margin">1. Iohn. <hi>5.</hi>4.</note> let it ſuffice them that God helpeth them, and alwayes reſt vpon this promiſſe, That our faith ſhall continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ouercome the worlde. Neuertheleſſe, the remedie is ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs, which is, wée muſt fight. True it is that Satan will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer leaue to beginne againe to aſſayle vs, but yet Ieſus Chriſte on
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7663:36"/> the otherſide, commaundeth vs to watch.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, he ſheweth that they which preſume vpon their owne ſtrengthes, that Satan will an hundred thouſand times ſooner o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe them, then that they ſhall get any one maiſtrie of him. What is it then that wée muſt doe? Forſooth, wée muſt humbly confeſſe that there is nothing in vs, and therfore muſt runne vnto our good God. And thus wée ſée what our true armour &amp; weap on is: what it is that putteth from vs all feare and terror, and what it is that muſt aſſure and reſolue vs to continue ſafe and ſounde euen vnto the ende: to wit, whenas we call vpon the name of god: For as Solomon ſaith, his name is an inuincible ſtrong Tower,<note place="margin">Pro. 18.<hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> and that the righteous which runneth to it, ſhall bée exalted. And that is it which is ſpoken by the Prophet Ioel,<note place="margin">Ioel. 2.32.</note> That although the world were turned vpſide down, yet whoſoeuer ſhal call vpon the name of the lord ſhal be ſaued.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts.</hi> 2.21.</note> Which thing is namely applied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the reigne of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, to the ende wée might be perſwaded, that although our ſaluation were as it were waue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and wée as it were ſee a thouſande hazardes, yet that God will protect vs, and wée féele his power alwayes néere vs, and ready to helpe vs, if ſo bée wée wyll ſéeke vnto him by prayers and ſupplications, which is the very ſumme and effect of that wee are to remember.</p>
               <p>Nowe, that wée might bée the better confirmed in this doctrine, let vs note, that when our Lorde Ieſus prayed, hée did not onely pray for himſelfe, and for his owne behoofe, but hath ſo conſecrated all our petitions and prayers, as that they are ſanctified, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of God according to his heartes deſire, as is ſaide in Iohn,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17.</note> Hée was ſanctified, that wée might bée ſanctified in him. And this may alſo bee a very good concluſion for vs. That hee prayed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his prayer is auaileable, and ſtrong, euen at this day, by meane whereof wée are all hearde? And this reaſon wée are highly to eſtéeme of, when hée ſaith, that <hi>the ſpirite is ready,</hi> but the fleſhe, weake: which declareth vnto vs, that wée haue all néede, of that remedy which hée héere ordeined for his Diſciples. For many thinke, that if they bee neuer ſo little well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that they haue gotten all the worlde: and this ſuppoſall in very déede maketh them nothing worth. And héereby they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſoone after ſo idle, and colde, as that they fall from GOD,
<pb facs="tcp:7663:37"/> and contemne his ayde: which is the cauſe alſo why God many times withdraweth him ſelf &amp; hideth his power. For it is good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that when men truſte too much vnto them ſelues, they ſhould bée left to their owne willes, that GOD might ſcorne their arrogant and fooliſh imagination. Wherefore, to the end, both great and ſmall, might knowe and vnderſtande that they ought not lightly to paſſe ouer the helpe of God, and the graces which they haue receiued of him, hée muſt therefore alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and increaſe that in them, which hée hath giuen vnto them, that they might be made ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g. It is ſaid here that <hi>the ſpirit is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, &amp;c.</hi> That is to ſay, that although wée féele ſome willingneſſe in our ſelues, and that God hath ſet vs in the right way, and giuen vs his hande, ſo that wée may finde by very good proofe that hée guideth vs by his holy ſpirite: Although I ſay, we haue all this, yet muſt we not bée ſlacke in praying. And why ſo? Becauſe if we well conſider the matter, wée are no better then a puft of winde. Now, no doubt of it wée ſhall finde many remnants of infirmities in vs, &amp; although god hath alredie ſo holpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, as that we are high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thanke him, and to magnifie his goodneſſe, yet is it good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wée ſhoulde ſtoupe and caſt downe our heads, and ſée in very déed that if hée forſake vs, wée ſhall ſoone, I ſay, not onely be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, but bée vtterly ouerthrowne. To be ſhort, our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte his meaning héere, is to ſhewe, that the moſt perfect, and forewarde of thoſe, vpon whom God hath enlarged the graces and vertues of his holy ſpirite, muſt notwithſtanding humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and carefully and fearefully walke, and call vpon God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery houre, that they might knowe that it is not enough for him to haue begunne, except hée make it perfect: and that all goodneſſe commeth from him: ſo that when hée hath giuen a good minde, hee muſt eftſoones graunt the perfourmance thereof: Forſomuch as, perſeuerance is the moſt ſpeciall and rareſt gift that may be. And thus we ſée whereunto the exhortation of our Lorde Ieſus ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</p>
               <p>Now, if they who call themſelues ſpirituall, to wit, who haue a feruent zeale to ſerue GOD, and ſtill haue recourſe vnto his Maieſtie with Prayers and ſupplications, are yet ſo weake, as that they may bee ouerthrowne, euen in the minute of an houre, except they continually call vpon GOD: Howe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7663:37"/> ſhall they then doe, who are ſo earthly and heauie as is lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, inſomuch as they are not able to traile their legges after them and haue ſcarſely any good motion, or yet one good thought: howe greatly ought theſe men, I ſay, in reſpect of the reſt inforce them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues? Let euery man therefore examine himſelfe, and wée ſhall finde our ſelues to bée ſo cold and blockiſhe, as when any queſtion ſhall bée mooued of praying vnto God, wee goe to it, ſometimes more for a faſhion, then for any affection and loue we haue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, when we ſee this to be in vs, let vs learne to bée diſpleaſed with ſuch a vice, and with ſuch a coldneſſe: yea &amp; let vs deteſt ſuch a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and doe our beſt to call vpon God, and lift vp our mindes vnto heauen, and ſéeke for the remedie which is héere ſet before vs Thus wee ſee in effect what it is that we muſt remember. For where it is ſaide that the Diſciples were a ſléepe the thirde time, yea although they were ſo liuely ſtirred vp (ouer and beſides that which we haue this morning ſpoken of, to wit, that we right well ſee that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte choſe vnto him no companion for the helping of him to finiſhe the worke of our ſaluation) Let vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo behold our dulneſſe: for it is moſt certaine, that wée haue no more ablenes then theſe thrée of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mention is héere made: and yet were they the moſt notable men of all the company, and thoſe whom Ieſus Chriſte had marked as it were to bee the very floure of the twelue, for the publiſhig of the Goſpell throughout the worlde. And although héere was already neuer ſo good a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, yet for all that, wée ſée howe weake they were. And this is ſet downe to this ende, that we ſhould altogether haue recourſe vnto the Sonne of God, and ſeeke for our want, in him: and not to bee faint hearted, whenas we ſhall féele ſuche weakneſſe in our ſelues. In very déede, the example of the Apoſtles muſt not giue vs occaſion to flatter ourſelues (as, many there are which wil ſay that they may very well ſléepe, becauſe that Peter, Iohn and Iames ſtept) But let vs be angrie with our ſelues for our ſinnes and know that our Lorde Ieſus is ready to receiue vs, if that wée will come vnto him.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, this hath alwayes béene the moſt ſpeciall reaſon which wee haue declared this morning. That what ſoeuer is in men, muſt néedes bée weake, to the ende wee might knowe that
<pb facs="tcp:7663:38"/> in him is the accompliſhment of our ſaluation, whom God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to bée our Mediator. And beſides, wée are to note, that the néerer wée come vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, wée ought then to bée moſt watchfull. For, the worldlinges, and ſuch as God hath cut of as rotten members, and forſaketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, neuer haue any great conflict: Becauſe the Diuell hath alreadie dominion ouer them. And therefore wée ſee that they may ſléepe at pleaſure. But as our Lorde Ieſus ſheweth vs this fauour, to call vs vnto himſelfe, and familiarly to come néere vs, euen ſo likewiſe doeth Satan prepare combates for vs, becauſe hée woulde retire vs from the obedience of the ſonne of God. And therefore, I ſay, when hée ſéeth vs in any good towardneſſe, then doeth hée moſt roughly aſſaile vs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let euery man make readie himſelfe, knowing whereunto God hath called him, and what his charge is. This then is the ſumme of that we are to kéepe in minde.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, where it is ſaid, <hi>Sleepe hence foorth and take your reſt, behold, the houre is at hande:</hi> this is as muche as if hée had ſaide that they ſhoulde bée ſoone ſodainely ſet vpon, except God watched ouer them, And yet by the way, hée checked them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, What? Doe you ſée in what ſtate you ſtande? Beholde the Diuell bendeth all his power for the diſtruction of mankinde, and it muſt come paſſe that in mée the kingdome of God muſt bée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, or els all creatures muſt periſhe: and yet you ſtill ſléepe héere. Nowe this admonition ſerued for the preſent: But in the ende, the Diſciples knewe that they muſt yéelde all the prayſe of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto God: yea conſidering their vnthankefulnes, which appeared in ſo beaſtly blockiſhnes. And ſo, wée are not admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed (as I haue already ſaid) that the ſonne of God muſt ſhew him ſelfe to bée our redéemer, euen himſelfe alone, without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, let vs eft ſoones learne, that it is néedefull that God ſhoulde watche ouer vs, ſo long as wée our ſelues doe ſléepe. For, how often ſhall it come to paſſe that the Diuell will oppreſſe vs an hundred thouſande times: and what way haue wée to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him, except God hath compaſſion on vs, although hee ſéeth vs therein to bée as it were like bruite beaſtes? But yet muſt not this giue vs occaſion to goe aſtray, and to leaue our prayers and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7663:38"/> ſupplications. But wée muſt rather continually call to minde this ſaying of the Pſalme, hée that watcheth ouer Iſrael nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſléepeth nor ſlumbereth. And therefore, let vs for our parts bée watchful, according to that exhortation which wée haue heard made vnto vs. And yet let vs vnderſtande thus much, that how euer wée watch, yet muſt God kéepe a good watche, or els our eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies woulde ſoone haue great aduantage of vs. It followeth that Ieſus Chriſte ſaide vnto his Diſciples, <hi>Ariſe, let vs goe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, hee is at hand, which betrayeth vs.</hi> Hée would not haue them to goe with him (as hath béene before ſaid) but becauſe hee would haue them ſée, howe that hee ſpared not himſelfe for them, nor yet for all mankinde, for hée offered himſelfe to receiue all the blowes, to frée them: that this ſaying might bée accompliſhed, <hi>That hee had loſt no whit of all that which his heauenly Father had giuen him, and committed vnto his charge and protection.</hi> Howbeit, hée ſheweth héereby that hee went willingly to death according to that which wée haue this morning handeled, that the Sacrifice of obedience muſt anſwere the blotting out of all our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions. For if our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte had not willingly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vp himſelf to appeaſe the wrath of God his Father, his death and paſſion had ſerued vs to no purpoſe: But hée came to this point, and declared howe hee had taken vpon him our nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hée would accompliſhe our redemption, and when he was in the principall action, hée meant not to giue ouer his office. For it is ſaide in the Story, <hi>That Iudas had giuen them a token, that whomſoeuer hee kiſſed, the ſame was Ieſus, and ſhould lay handes on him, and when hee was come neere him, he kiſſed him, and ſaid vnto him, All Haile, or God ſaue thee Maiſter.</hi> Nowe let vs note, that this was the manner of ſaluting, As wée ſee, that in ſome Countries they imbrace one another, and other ſome ſhake handes. And the maner of the Iewes was altogether to kiſſe one another, as wée ſée by the holy Scripture. Moreouer, a man would thinke it very ſtrange, that Iudas being gone form the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Ieſus Chriſt but a while before, to wit, euen the ſelfeſame night before, returned and kiſſed him, as if hée had come from ſome farre iourney. But he vſed this maner of curteſie becauſe hée came lyke a man halfe afraide. And marke, why it is
<pb facs="tcp:7663:39"/> ſaid in the other Goſpel, That he ſaid, Maiſter, God ſaue thée, or all haile Maiſter, hée ſéemed at that time to be very angrie, that his Maiſter was thus dealt with: and when he ſaw ſuch a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny come to take him, hée drew néere and kiſſed Ieſus Chriſte, as who ſhoulde ſay, O my good Maiſter, They ſéeke for thée, ſee howe thine enimies compaſſe thée, ſéeking to take away thy life, and to cut thée of, from amongſt men if they once lay hold on the. Nowe this ſeemed to bée a ſigne of great compaſſion in Iudas. But it is ſaid ſoone after that Ieſus Chriſte rebuked him, ſaying, <hi>Friende, Wherefore art thou come?</hi> Which is aſmuch as if he had ſaide, Thou wicked man which haſt ſitte at my Table with mée, and waſt as one of my owne body, when wee were vnited together as the children of God (for as I was your head, euen ſo did I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge you to bée as my members) and nowe thou commeſt be betray mée, yea euen with a kiſſe. And héerevpon wee haue to note, that the Sonne of God muſt néedes bee marked, that the Scripture might bée the better thought of and beléeued, and wée might knowe, that GOD had choſen him to bée our redéemer. For all this was prefigured in the perſon of Dauid, who was as it were a Mirrour and image of the Sonne of God.

And thus wee ſee what the meaning of the holy Ghoſte is to ſhewe vs, that is, that nothing came to paſſe vnto the Sonne of GOD, which was not both ſpoken of and figured before, to the end we might be ſo much the more confirmed, that is hee whom GOD had alwayes eſtabliſhed, ſince hee carried with him ſuch, and ſo infallible markes.</p>

               <p>Moreouer wée ſée in the perſon of Iudas, that the Church of God ſhall continually be ſubiect to much treaſon. True it is, that it is verie much to haue Satan and all his furniture againſt vs, and all that which wée haue before ſpoken of, and beſides, to haue them alſo our enemies who openly fight againſt God, and ſéeke altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ouerthrow of his Church. This, I tell you, is verie much that wée haue to deale againſt ſuche enemies: But yet it pleaſeth the Lord to proue our patience herein, that is, that there ſhould bee alwayes amiddeſt vs home enemies, who ſhould be full of treaſon and diſloialtie. And although this be an horrible peſtilence, yet ſhal the Church neuer be without it, nor cleane rid thereof. In déed wée ought to looke well vnto it, and kéepe vs from it, and it is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of euerie man as much as lyeth in him, to roote and blot out this filthy infection: and yet when we haue all done, God will haue a number of Iudaſſes continually to be in it. For ſince, it was figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Dauid, and perfourmed in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, it is méet that wée ſhould be made like vnto him (according to that ſaying of Saint Paule) for he beare as it were the enſignes,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.29.</note> and badges of the houſe of God, being the firſt born of all the faithful. And therfore our eſtate ought to be like vnto his. But we may here ſée, that this is ſpoken of a troubled co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, when as God ſendeth a troubled, frantike, or blockiſhe minde, whereof he oftentimes ſpeaketh by his Prophetes. Wherefore, let vs here looke vpon Iudas, who ſheweth the rewarde of thoſe which wittingly fight againſt God, that they muſt néedes become ſo deſperate, as that there is in them neyther ſenſe nor reaſon: and yet notwithſtanding, altogether goe about hypocritically to hide it, vntill ſuch time as God ſpyte of their téethes draweth, and bringeth them vnto their laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. It ſhoulde ſéeme at the firſt ſight, that theſe two thinges ſhoulde bée contrarie the one to the other, that a man ſhoulde runne his head againſt God, lyke a wylde Bull, and ſo forget him as to doe nothing elſe but ſpit at the Sonne, and be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie with nature, and yet notwithſtanding goeth about to hyde him ſelfe with ſubtlenes, and thinketh to haue gotten ſomething through his hypocriſie. It may be ſaide, that theſe two thinges agrée not verie well together: But we ſée them agrée well enough in Iudas For he had founde by good proofe the heauenly power of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: &amp; for his owne part, had both ſéene, and
<pb facs="tcp:7663:40"/> done a number of myracles in his name. And although he knewe, the Sonne of God, to be Lord both of life and death, yet betrayeth hée him, and biddeth them wiſely to kéepe him, for otherwiſe (ſaith hée) hée will ſoone be gone and eſcape from you. We ſée héere then that Iudas, was altogether without ſence and reaſon, and as it were like a frantike or madde man: and yet by his kiſſe, and faire wordes, in ſaying, Alas good Maiſter, hée thought by theſe ſhiftes honeſtly to diſcharge him ſelfe. But ſée howe Satan bleareth their eyes whom hée holdeth within his nettes.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore learne in the firſt place to humble our ſelues, to the ende none of vs ſpurne againſt this ſo hard a ſtone: to wit, that we make not warre againſt our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. And therefore let vs beware howe wée lift vp our ſelues in ſo deuiliſhe a rage, as to fight againſt the trueth, and ſo ſkirmiſhe agaynſt our conſciences, as wittingly to prouoke the wrath of God againſt vs, as if wée woulde ſtande at defiaunce with him. Let vs, I ſay, take héde of this thing: and in the meane while, let vs not ſo flatter our ſelues in our hypocriſie, and fonde deuiſes, leaſt in the ende wée deceiue and beguile our ſelues. For wee ſée howe it fell out with Iudas (as the ſtorie telleth vs) he néeded no iudge to condemne him, nor yet to bée enforced to vnſay that hée had ſaide: But hée confeſſed that hée had ſolde and betrayed innocent blood. And yet craued hée not pardon for his miſdéed: but went, and deſperately hung him ſelfe, and therewithall his bowelles burſt out.</p>

Let vs then take héede vnto all this. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, although the wordes of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, did not at the firſt, ſhewe their effect in Iudas, yet in the ende, by the vertue of the ſame wordes, yet it fell out that hée hung him ſelfe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.6.</note> without looking for any other condemnation. And in verie déede S.

And what were the wordes hee ſpake: forſooth euen this, <hi>I am hee.</hi> And by and by they all went backe, and fell foorthwith to the grounde. Wherevpon came this falling? Herein we ſée, that although our Lord Ieſus Chriſt humbled him ſelf for a time, yea and was made of no reputation, yet kept he with him, when he thought good, his heauenly power, that he might throw downe headlong all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, whenſoeuer it pleaſed him.

By this we haue to learne, to feare the wordes of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: and although he is not here conuerſant amongſt vs, after a viſible ſort, neuertheles, ſince the Goſpel is preached by his authoritie, &amp; that he ſaith, he that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth you,<note place="margin">Luk. 8.16.</note> heareth mée: Let vs learne moſt reuerently to receiue whatſoeuer is preached in his name, &amp; ſubmit our ſelues thereto: and we ſhal finde y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this ſaying which thus made the ſouldiers, and thoſe that were ſent againſt him, too fall, muſt be our onely foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, &amp; ſtay. For what is all our ioy &amp; comfort without the ſonne of God, appeareth vnto vs, &amp; that we ſée him nigh vs, &amp; ſheweth vs what a one he is, &amp; wherefore it was that God his Father ſent him vnto vs? And ſo, let vs vnderſtand, by this ſaying, <hi>I am hee,</hi> That when it ſhal pleaſe our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt to manifeſt him ſelfe, as he doth to all his faithful, that he therin declareth vnto vs, why he calleth vs vnto him ſelfe, why he is come downe vnto vs, &amp; why he dwelleth in vs, by the power of his holie ſpirite, and thus we ſée wherein all our felicitie and quietneſſe reſteth. But if we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come rebellious, and contemne the worde of God, as a number of prophane men doe, wheron we ought to build our ſaluation let vs be aſſured that it will be a lightening to throw vs all downe head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the pit of hell. And ſo let vs feare, and although our Lord Ieſus Chriſt openeth vnto vs the gate, and ſaieth after an other manner, beholde mée, which hée hath not done to thoſe who were his profeſſed enemies, let vs come vnto him. Moreouer, let vs alſo learne, ſo patiently to beare the treaſons which wée ſée to bée at this day in the Church, as that we yet abhorre and deteſt them, and ſo ſhewe our ſelues truely and in déede to cleaue faſt vnto the Sonne of God, becauſe he is our head: and ſince we haue his truth, let vs liue ſo together one with an other, as that we may be vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together in true &amp; brotherly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cord. And this is it that wée are to remember. But howe euer it be, let vs learne this principall point for our inſtruction, which we muſt gather out of this Text, to wit, That the Sonne of God became fully and wholy obedient, that he might repaire our tranſgreſſions. It is verie true (as I haue alreadie ſaide) that all the members of God muſt be ruled after his example: and it is great reaſon, ſince hee who is Lorde
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7663:41"/> and maiſter ouer all, ſo humbled him ſelf, that we ſhould be readie both in life and death to obey our God: But yet let vs vnderſtand, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this is an eſpeciall obedience which our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this behalfe, to wit, by reaſon of the fruit &amp; effect which came thereby. The Apoſtle tooke the death of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt for an example, verie wel, for it ſtrengthened them when as they were to abide the combat for the teſtimony of the Goſpel: then ſlept they not: for we ſée their watchfulneſſe, and readineſſe in the following of their calling: neither feared they the torments of death, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them ſelues when God called them thereto for the glorifying of his name, and the confeſſing of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: But they chiefly ſtood vpon this, that all our ſpottes are waſhed and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the ſheading of the blood of our Redéemer, that he fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied God his father for all our debtes for which we were bound, and hath obteined for vs perfect righteouſneſſe. And therefore wée muſt vnderſtand the difference that is betwéene the head and the members: &amp; learne, that by nature we are wholy giuen to doe euil, and although God hath partly regenerated vs, yet doeth our fleſhe ſtil reſiſt againſt his maieſtie notwithſtanding through the power &amp; vertue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which we ſée to be in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, let vs not leaue of to do thoſe things which may pleaſe our God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his heartes deſire. And although we cannot doe the good we would, but do the euill we would not, and oftentimes ſlip, or els are too too ſlack, let vs looke vnto that which the Sonne of God hath ſuffered for the amending of all our offences. and behold that he hath ſo combatted, as that he was not againſt it, when as our ſinnes &amp; offences were layd vnto him, as this morning hath more at large béen ſpoken. Seeing then that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, hath fully &amp; wholy made ſatiſfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that although we at this day haue done our beſt to obey God, &amp; cannot come to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> perfection we ought, but continually traile our legges after vs, &amp; haue many thinges in vs which may be ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, yet let vs know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhal not but pleaſe God, &amp; our imperfections be continually aboliſhed through the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhal neuer come in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count againſt vs before his maieſtie. And beſides, let euerie one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the meaſure of the faith, &amp; grace which he hath receiued, ſtriue to fight, vntil the time we attaine vnto the heauenly reſt. And although we ſée our weaknes to be ſo great, &amp; conuinced that wée
<pb facs="tcp:7663:42"/> are not able once to thinke a good thought, and being caſt downe, not able to riſe againe, except God reach vs his hand, and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs euerie minute, Let vs beſéeche him to augment in vs the graces of his holie ſpirite, as he hath promiſed vs, and hath ſet Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt before vs to be our head and Captaine, to the ende wée might get that victorie which hee hath obteined for vs, the fruite whereof we alreadie féele, and then ſhall perfectly and throughly féele.</p>
               <p>Let vs nowe fall downe before the Maieſtie of our good God, in ſuch acknowledgement of our offences, as that it may rightly humble vs before him, and bring vs to true repentance: and more and more labour to make voide whatſoeuer is againſt his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. And becauſe we cannot be without conflicts and enemies, that it would pleaſe him to powre vpon his, the ſuccour which hée hath promiſed: and make vs ſo to féele it, as that we may reſiſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end, all temptations: and learne alſo to thanke him for all our victories, without attributing any of them vnto our ſelues, to the end we prouoke not his wrath through arrogancy, but beſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching him to continue his graces continually in vs, and proſecute more and more the thing which he hath done and begunne in vs. That hée will not onely beſtowe this grace, &amp;c.</p>

We ſee this ouer much in the example of Peter. For as after ſhalbe ſhewed, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, hee ſweare to his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; yet was he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture his life, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he had no ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement. Nowe, what was the cauſe that made him to drawe? Surely he did it as it were in a furie: For his Maiſter taught him not to doe any ſuch thing. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he forſooke his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, knew he not before this ſaying, Whoſoeuer ſhall deny me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, I will denie him before my father which is in heauen?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.33.</note> But he was (as I haue before ſaid) cockbrayned: &amp; this fond deſire which he had to defend our Lord Ieſus after his maner, caried him away. Let vs therefore after his example, learne to endeuour our ſelues to walke whither ſoeuer God calleth vs, and not to thinke it any hard matter to do which he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth: neither let vs attempt any thing, no not ſo much as the wagging of our litle finger, except God allow of it, and that we haue a teſtimonie that he guideth vs. And thus much for this point, And in very déede, our Lorde Ieſus ſheweth him that he hath grieuouſly offended, becauſe he was not ignoraunt of this poynt of the lawe, which ſayeth, that whoſoeuer ſheddeth mans blood, his blood ſhall be ſhed agayne.</p>
               <p>And therefore Sainte Peter was to haue kepte this leſſon in mind, That God would not haue anie force nor viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vſed.<note place="margin">Gen. 9.6.</note> And (that which is more) in what Schoole was hee brought vp by the ſpace of thrée yéeres? And beſides, did not our Lorde Ieſus put him in mind, as much as was poſſible, to behaue himſelfe gently &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly? From whence then ſhould he fetch any allowance of this his raſhe dealing. Wherefore wée haue ſo much the rather to obſerue that which wée haue already ſpoken: to wit, that if wée fetche our zeale from men, &amp; bée flattered, &amp; well like off, yet will GOD condemne vs, if wée tranſgreſſe his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment neuer ſo little. And therefore wée ſhal neuer bée ſaide to bée prayſe worthy, except we walke as God teacheth vs by his word. For ſo ſoone as we paſſe this meaſure, all our vertues ſtinke and become abhominable. Loe then what becommeth of all our deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
<pb facs="tcp:7663:44"/> For when ſoeuer we ſhall haue trauailed neuer ſo much to do the thing which ſeemeth good in our owne braines, God wyll vtterly condemne it, without it be ſquared by his word: For he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not nor accompteth any thing to be lawful in truth, but his very word. But as for the hiſtory which we are now in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is much more to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered of. For, the matter which we haue already touched is general: but this ſaing properly belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vnto the death and paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, when hée ſaieth, <hi>Thinkeſt thou that I cannot pray to my father, and he will giue me more then twelue legions of Angels.</hi> Now a legion, in thoſe dayes was woont to be four or fiue thouſand men. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (ſaith hée) ſée what an heauenly army I am able to haue, and yet am I contented to put all this quietlye vp, why then comeſt thou to take vpon thée héere more then God would haue thée to doo, or can abide thou ſhouldeſt doo.</p>
               <p>Now it is very lawfull for vs to call vpon God, and to beſéeche him to defend our lyfe: and as he accompteth it to be precious, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo muſt we deſyre him, that it would pleaſe him alſo to kéepe and preſerue it. But our Lord Ieſus telleth hym that hee woulde nor ought not now to doo it. And wherefore then woulde <hi>Peter</hi> vſe violence, contrary to that order which God hath permitted and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed by his worde. If a meane which of it ſelfe is lawfull, ought not to be practiſed: what ſhall become of that whiche God hath forbidden, and declared to be puniſhable?</p>
               <p>We then héere ſée (as I haue already ſaid) that the ſonne of God ſubmitted him ſelfe to all rebuke and ſhame, and deſired rather to be bound and faſt manacled as a malefactor and a condemned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then to be made a lyer by any myracle, and would haue god to ſtretch forth his arme to warrant him. And héereby wee may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande how greatly he eſtéemed of our ſaluation. Howbeit héere is one point which I haue already noted: to wit, that he ſendeth vs back to the will &amp; purpoſe of God his father. For w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out this alſo it ſhuld ſéeme ſtrange, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would not craue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aid which he right wel knew he might haue: &amp; it ſhould ſéeme he tempted God, whenas he would not pray for it. For, we are promiſed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Angels ſhall be round about them which feare God: yea &amp; ſhal beare them in their handes,<note place="margin">Pſal. <hi>34.7.</hi> Pſal. 91.11</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhal not hurt them ſelues againſt a ſtone, &amp; no euill ſhal come to them in their waies: now when God promiſeth vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7663:44"/> thing, he would that the ſame ſhould put vs in minde to praye vnto him for it. And therefore as often as we are in néede, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe muſt be vnto him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might place his Angels to guide vs, euery one according to his roome and office. And this order we ſée y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Patriarks &amp; Fathers practiſed. For thus ſaid <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Angel of the Lorde who neuer fayled mée,<note place="margin">

Wherefore then would our Lord Ieſus Chriſt haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to help him?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.43.</note> For bicauſe (as S. <hi>Luke</hi> reciteth) he was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon before comforted, and the Angels ſerued him, to the ende to mittigate the anguiſh wherein he was. Why, it ſhould ſéeme then that he contemned the neceſſary ayde of God, no not ſo, but he reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that which afterwarde he ſaide, <hi>How ſhoulde the ſcriptures be fulfilled? &amp;c.</hi> As if he ſhould haue ſaide, that if we doubted of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, we might and ought then to beſéeche the Lorde to looke vpon vs with his eye of mercy and compaſſion, ſo make vs by all meanes poſſible to féele his power and vertue: But when we are reſolued that of neceſſitie it muſt be ſo, and know the will of God to be ſuch, then muſt we none otherwiſe beſéech hym but to fortify vs with an inuincible and conſtant power, neuer to gaine ſay it, nor yet be carried away with our affections, but wholye goe with chearefull courage and countenaunce whether ſoeuer it pleaſeth him to call vs. As for example, if our enimies perſecute vs, and we know not how God hath determined to deale w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs, nor what wyll be our ende, we are to beſéeche him, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as our life is deare vnto him, and hath taken it to kéepe, that he would alſo ſhew our dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraunce by the effect. And when we are perſuaded that God mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to call vs vnto him ſelfe, we muſt leaue of all kinde of queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and fully reſolue our ſelues to obey his maieſties vnchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able decrée and ordenaunce. And thus we ſée the meaninge of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. For he prayed all his lyfe long, yea &amp; before he entred into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mighty combat which he abode, he beſought his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if it were poſſible, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that cup might pas ouer him: But hee by &amp; by concluded, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſince God his father had ſo ordeyned it, &amp; ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he muſt diſcharge that charge which was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto him which was to offer vp an euerlaſti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſacrifice, to blot out y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſins of the world: &amp; when he ſée him ſelfe to be called thereto, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was a reſolute concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſet down, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame I ſay was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very cauſe why
<pb facs="tcp:7663:45"/> he abſteyned from praying to God for the contrary And therfore he would not that eyther Angels or yet men ſhoulde helpe him, nor yet to haue God his father cauſe him to féele his power for his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance from death: but it ſufficed him that hee had this ſpirite of conſtancie, willingly to goe to doe his office. Loe héere the full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and meaning hereof. We nowe ſée in the firſt place, that the will of GOD muſt ſo ſtay and bridle vs, as that when wee thinke thinges to be farre vnlike and againſt al reaſon, to eſtéeme more of the ordinance of God, then of any thing that our fond and vayne brayne can comprehend. Wherefore we muſt throw our imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s cleane vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> féet, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we perceiue that God hath otherwiſe prouided. And this is one péece of the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of our faith, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we thinke God to be ſo wiſe, as that he hath power &amp; authority to doe whatſoeuer pleaſeth him. And although wee can make reaſons to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrary, let vs wel vnderſtand that they are but ſmoke &amp; vanity, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God knoweth al things, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no ſecretes are hid, yea and his wil to be the rule of al wiſedome and righteouſneſſe. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, whatſoeuer our mind ſaith to the contrary, it is by reaſon of our groſſe vnderſtanding, for we know that the wiſedome of God is infinite, and ſcarcely haue wée thrée drammes of wit. It is there fore no maruell though men grow wilde and ſauage, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not as they would the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. And why ſo? Forſooth bicauſe we are very ydiots. And in very déede, ſo long as our wit and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon beare any rule, it is euen very beaſtly: Wherefore, becauſe we cannot finde out the bottomleſſe depth of Gods iudgementes, let vs learne to honour that which is kept ſecrete from vs: Let vs I ſay, humbly &amp; reuerently honour it, and ſay that whatſoeuer God doth is iuſt and right, though we cannot perceiue how. And thus much for this, Nowe, ſéeing it was the will of God that his ſonne ſhould be put to death, let not vs be aſhamed of that which hee ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: nor yet think y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the wicked did beare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſway, &amp; that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne of God could not haue found meanes to haue defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded himſelfe: For all came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wil, &amp; vnchangeable decrée of God, which he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined therin. And therfore we ſée why our Lord Ieſus ſaith in S. Luke.<note place="margin">Luke. <hi>22.</hi>53.</note> This is now your very houre, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> power of darknes. As if he ſhuld haue ſaid, what? make no great boaſt of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you haue done For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuel is your maiſter &amp; ringleader: By w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> he ſheweth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they did nothing but by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaue of God: And although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuel vrged the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereto,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7663:45"/> yet neither they nor hee coulde haue brought any thing to paſſe, if God had not lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed them. Thus we ſée in ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me, that our eyes &amp; all our ſenſes muſt be faſtened vpon the wil of God, and vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting councel, when we heare the death and paſſion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt ſpoken of, For he declared that this was the will of God, becauſe it is writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For if Ieſus Chriſt had not had ſome te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing which God his father had ordeined, he might as yet haue ſtood in doubt, but he knew what his office was. And God would not haue ſent him downe here below, but that hée gaue him forthwith an expreſſe charge withal. It is very true, that inaſmuch as our Lord Ieſus is God eternal, that he néeded not to be taught of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcripture: but inaſmuch as he is our redéemer, &amp; is clothed with our nature, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might be of right brotherhood, it was méet he ſhuld be taught the holy ſcripture, &amp; we ſée alſo that he at no time refuſed any ſuch inſtruction. So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe God ſhewed him, wherunto he had called him, we ſée wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he eſtabliſhed himſelfe: &amp; we alſo ſée why he behaued himſelfe like a priſoner, &amp; would not ſtart away, becauſe he knew that he muſt fulfil the charge co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto him, which was, to offer himſelfe a ſacrifice for the rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vs al: And therefore we are to learne, that forſomuch as the will of God is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete, &amp; inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſible in himſelfe, we muſt haue recourſe vnto the holy ſcripture. True it is, that God determineth of things in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete councel, which wee thinke to come by chaunce (as wee ſay) which is not ſhewed vnto vs: neither haue wee alwaies a ſpeciall reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that we are able to ſay, that God hath determined either this thing or that. And therfore muſt we ſuſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d our iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: for we ſée why it is that we pray him to heale vs of our ſicknes, or why we would haue him to deliuer vs from any other affliction where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into we are fallen. And why doe wée ſo? Becauſe wee knowe not what he wil doe. In very déed, we muſt not appoint him a law, but that this conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt alwaies be adioyned, that his wil be done: But all our prayers ought to tende to this pointe, to craue at his handes whatſoeuer he knoweth to be neceſſary &amp; profitable for vs, and to leaue vnto himſelfe whatſoeuer is laid vp in his ſecret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, to the end hee might doe that which to his maieſty ſhall ſéeme beſt. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wee haue a teſtimony out of the holy ſcripture, that God willeth any thing, we muſt not (as I haue already ſaid) ſtand againſt it. Now, we are here a great deale better confirmed as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb facs="tcp:7663:46"/> the perſon of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, that hee was not thus cruelly afflicted, &amp; ſo ſhamefully &amp; ſlanderouſly handled, onely as the vngodly &amp; wicked men luſted, but becauſe God had ſo decréed it. And how appeareth this by the holy ſcripture? For were not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacrifices in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law ordeined two thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d yeres before Ieſus Chriſt was borne? And had not God enſpired &amp; taught the auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers how to ſacrifice, before the law was eyther giuen, or written. Or could the blood of bruite beaſtes obtaine remiſſion for ſinnes, and make men acceptable vnto God? No: But it was to ſhew, that God ſhould be reconciled by a Redéemer whom he had eſtabliſhed: and ſithens that time he hath ſet downe an expreſſe mention and declaration by the ſcriptures.<note place="margin">Iſaiah. 53.<hi>2.</hi>
                  </note> We alſo ſée howe the Prophets haue ſpoken thereof, and namely he alledgeth them. For, when Iſaiah ſaieth, That the Redéemer ſhould be diſfigured, and diſdayned, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and vnbeautifull like a Leaper, ſcourged and beaten by the hande of God, that he ſhould be an horrible thing to beholde: to be ſhort, that his life ſhould be taken from him: in what power was this prophecied of? was it becauſe God could not withſtande Satan and all the rable of the wicked? No: But it was becauſe he had pronounced by the mouth of Iſaiah the thing which he had before appointed.<note place="margin">Dan. 9.<hi>24.</hi>
                  </note> And in Daniell it is a great deale more expreſly ſet downe. Séeing then it is ſo, that God hath declared that his onely Sonne muſt be ſacrificed for our redemption and ſaluation, we are nowe much more confirmed in that which I haue alreadie ſpoken, which is, we muſt alwayes ſée that it is the hand of God which gouerneth, when as we ſee the Sonne of God to be ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected to the ſlaunders and reproches of mortall men. Wee ſee alſo why Saint Peter namely ſaieth in the Actes,<note place="margin">Act. 4, <hi>27.</hi>
                  </note> That Iudas, all the Iewes, yea, and all the ſouldiers, and Pylate alſo, had done none other thing, but that which the hande and Councell of God had determined: as hereafter ſhall more at large be handled. And here we ſée wherevnto wée muſt looke, when we would not be troubled in our fooliſh imaginations, which is, that God hath ſent downe here belowe his onely begotten Sonne, that he might accept his obedience through his death and paſſion, for the taking away of all our ſinnes and iniquities. And this is the ſecond point which I haue handled, to wit, the fruit &amp; benefit which commeth to vs by the ſuffering of our Lorde Ieſus. For if we knew not why it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7663:46"/> was, we ſhould loſe the taſt of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is here recited vnto vs. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is ſaid y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was bound &amp; manacled for our deliuerance: and that we ſée what the ſtate &amp; condition of our nature is, to wit, that Satan holdeth vs vnder the tyranny of ſinne and death, that wée are very bondſlaues, ſo that in ſtead that we were created after the image of God, there muſt néeds be found in vs nothing but corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and accurſedneſſe, &amp; muſt be led into this curſed captiuitie like miſerable &amp; wretched beaſtes. Now, when we know all this, and that we on the other ſide ſée, that the Sonne of God refuſed not to be ſlaunderouſly bound, to the end that al the ſpiritual bonds of ſin &amp; death, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> kéepe vs bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage of Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, might be broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſunder, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue we wherefore to glorify God, &amp; w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mouth to triumph in the death &amp; paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke.</hi> 22.51.</note> &amp; in his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, wherof me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion here is made. Thus we ſée what we haue to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber in this place: &amp; héervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſt ſaith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our Lord Ieſus healed the ſeruaunt whom Peter hurte, not becauſe he was woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be healed, but for the ſaluing of the offence that was geuen. For this had béen a defaming of the doctrine of the Goſpel, and of the redemption of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, (I call that the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt which hee purchaſed for vs) if this hurt had not béen healed: ſo that it might haue béene ſayde that hée had withſtood the Gouernour of the Countrey, and all the Prieſts, and that he kept in that place, as it were a ſtanding, for théeues &amp; robbers. And this was to haue darkened all the glory of the ſonne of God, and to haue made the Goſpel for euer to haue béene ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. We ſée alſo that this zeale of Peters was diueliſhe: For the Diuell went about to make Ieſus Chriſte and all his doctrine to be infamous. And héere we ſée to what end all our painted deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tendeth, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we wil ſerue God as pleaſeth our ſelues, &amp; euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take leaue to doe whatſoeuer he thinketh beſt in his owne eyes.</p>
               <p>Wherfore, Ieſus Chriſt ment to take away this offence, to the end hée would not haue his doctrine to bée ſlaundered. Howbéeit wée may héere ſée the abhominable vnthankfulneſſe of ſuch as are not mooued by ſuche a myracle. For behold, the Souldiers who came to manacle our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, ſée what a number of wayes the power of the Spirite of GOD wrought in him: For, but a little before, he had with a woord of his mouth, made them turne backe: and by and by, hée healeth a man who hadd his eare cutte of: and yet all this did them no good. Wée ſee then,
<pb facs="tcp:7663:47"/> that when the Deuil hath once bewitched vs, and bleared our eyes, that neyther the graces of GOD, nor yet all his power, can touch vs, but that we will followe, and goe on in our furie and rage: and haue as it were euen a ſwines ſnowte to roote in euerie thing: and let God ſay and doe what he pleaſe, yet will we, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually remayne obſtinate, which is an horrible thing. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to beſéeche the Lorde to graunt vs wiſedome that wée may profite by his graces, and be brought to loue him, and that we may be alſo touched when he lifteth vp his hand to ſhew vs, that he is our iudge, ſo that we be not afeard to return vnto him in true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. And this is in effect the thing that we are to learne here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. But howe euer it was, our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt ſtopped the mouthes of the vngodly when as hee had healed <hi>Cayphas</hi> ſeruant. Herevpon it is ſaide, that <hi>Ieſus was led to Cayphas houſe, and was there examined to the ende.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 18.13.</note> Nowe, for the making ſhorte of the matter, wée wil not ſpeake of that which Saint Iohn writeth of <hi>Annas,</hi> who was <hi>Cayphas</hi> father in lawe: and it may bée that Ieſus Chriſt was led thither for honours ſake, or els becauſe the way ſo ſerued, hoping that all were there aſſembled. Well, Ieſus was ledde to <hi>Cayphas</hi> houſe, and there examined. And it is name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſayde, <hi>That the high Prieſtes ſought falſe witneſſe againſt him, but they founde none.</hi> And in the ende, <hi>That there came twoo falſe witneſſes,</hi> and ſayd, That he ſaide, he woulde buylde vp the temple agayne in thrée dayes, héere wée ſay that our Lorde Ieſus was charged: not that the high prieſts were moued with any zeale: as many times they which perſecute innocentes, thinke they doe God high ſeruice, for in very déede wée ſee, how Saint Paule was driuen with ſuch a fury,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.</note> as that hée was like vnto a théefe (for ſo he calleth himſelfe) who waſted and ſpoyled euery where: and yet thought himſelf to be a very zealous man. But it fared not ſo with <hi>Cayphas</hi> and his company. For what was it that they ſought, but onely vniuſtly to ouerthrowe Ieſus Chriſt? And thus wée ſee that it was very ambytion that draue them, manifeſtly to ſtande agaynſt God, which is a moſt horrible thing. For <hi>Cayphas</hi> and all his company were the children of <hi>Leui,</hi> euen an holy Tribe which GOD himſelfe had choſen? and not menne, for God had ſo appoynted yt by his Lawe. In very déede there was a villanous and horrible corruption amongeſt them, becauſe the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7663:47"/> prieſthood was bought at thoſe dayes, and whereas it ſhould haue béene an office for tearme of life (as God had ordayned it) euerye one circumuented his fellow, and whoſoeuer brought the greateſt ſumme of mony, carried away this dignitie. Now, this was a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous and deteſtable corruption, that they woulde make them ſelues lyke vnto théeues and vnlawfull dealers in ſo holy and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable an eſtate, neuer the leſſe, the Prieſt alwayes continued in the tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> which God had conſecrated to doe him ſeruice. And yet we ſée that they became all the enemies of God, Satan had made them all drunke, yea they were all ſtarke madd againſt the redéemer of the world, who was the ende of the law.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore héereuppon note, that they whiche are in dignitie and in high degrée, will not at all times ſo faithfully doo their duties, but that they had néede beware of themſelues, euen as of thoſe which might become the enemies of God. And héerein wee may ſée the ouer groſſe folly of the Papiſtes, when they reſt vpon this title and dignitie of prieſthood. For, put the caſe that God had commaunded there ſhould be a Pope (which neuer was commaunded) and that his ſeat ſhould be at <hi>Rome</hi> (which is yet a leſſe matter) howbeit if all this were true, yet wée ſée that in the perſon of <hi>Cayphas</hi> and his like, as many as haue bene aduaunced to honor, may abuſe their power and authoritie. And therfore let not vs be ſo fooliſh as to occupie our heades about maſkes: neither yet let God loſe his authoritie, when ſoeuer any honorable title is geuen vs: as we ſée the Papiſts doo, when as they forſake all the holy ſcripture &amp; reuerence their idoles. Let vs learne then not to leſſen the glory of God, vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coulor of any worldly dignity, but let him haue all his ſoueraigne dominion.<note place="margin">Pſal. 118.22.</note> And thus much for this point. And as for any offence which we may conceiue in our owne fantaſies, let vs marke that which is ſaide in the Pſalme (as alſo our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath before alleaged) That hée is the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtone which the builders forſooke.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.42.</note> And who were they that were the builders of the houſe and Church of God? forſooth the Prieſts: for it is they that ſhould indéede diſcharge them ſelues of that office: &amp; yet they forſooke the head corner ſtone which god had laid. And although this ſtone was refuſed, yet was it laide in the chiefe place of the building: that is to ſay, God left not to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh that which he had ordayned by his councell, when he raiſed
<pb facs="tcp:7663:48"/> vp his onely ſonne, and had aduanced him agreat deale more, then hee was before abaſed:<note place="margin">Phil. <hi>2.</hi>10.</note> For euery knée muſt bow to hym. Now, when it is ſayde that the Prieſtes went about to ſéeke falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt him, they dyd it not ſimply to forge or feinge a falt againſt hym, but that they might haue ſome coulor and cloke to vexe and greeue our Lord Ieſus. And this is verye true, that hee ſpake theſe wordes, deſtroye you this Temple, and within thrée dayes I wyll build it vp agayne. And héere wee ſée the wordes of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt as they procéeded out of his mouth.<note place="margin">Ioh. <hi>2.</hi>19.</note> Now, the witneſſes which were brought in rehearce the very ſelfe ſame words, wherfore, a man would ſay that theſe were good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful witneſſes: &amp; yet the holy ghoſt calleth them falſe witneſſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they turned this ſaying wickedly: For our Lord Ieſus ſpake of his body, which was the true temple of his diuine maieſtie. For the materiall Temple which was builte in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was but a figure, &amp; ſhadow therof, as we know: But the whole fulneſſe of the Godhead had his being in our Lorde Ieſus, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, yea corporally and ſubſtantially. And therefore héere is to be noted,<note place="margin">Col. <hi>2.</hi>9.</note> that we muſt not ſimply looke into the words of a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monye, but to the meaning of the ſpeaker. Now, this is a verye good and profytable inſtruction for vs, becauſe wée are ſo greatly giuen to wickedneſſe and leaſing, that if wee haue any coulor, it is inough, and doo thinke that God hath pardoned vs, when wee haue by any ſuch falſe meanes charged any man. And therfore, we muſt not ſtay ſimply vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> words, neither yet vpon the maner &amp; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but looke to the worthines of the cauſe. For they which may at al times defend &amp; ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue depoſed nothing but that which was ſaid or done, are yet take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before god for falſ witneſſes, as here we ſée: wherupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Cayphas</hi> ſaid vnto Ieſus chriſt <hi>What is the matter? anſwereſt thou nothing? ſeeſt thou not that theſe men witnes againſt thee?</hi> And yet Ieſus Chriſt al this while, held his peace, &amp; put vp al theſe reuiling and ſlaunderous words. Now, it may bee thought a ſtrange thing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ieſus Chriſt who had very iuſt occaſion to diſproue ſuch a falſe teſtimony, did not once gaine ſay it: howbeit) as I haue before ſaid, and as héereafter ſhall more at large appeare) Ieſus chriſt was not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to defend his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine as before he had done. And therfore we are wiſely to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> circumſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces: for, after Ieſus chriſt had faſted in the wildernes, god his father ſent him to pupliſh y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrin of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7663:48"/> Now wée ſée that all that time, he alwaies mightily defended the doctrine whereof he was a miniſter: and wée ſee alſo how hée ſet himfelfe againſt whatſoeuer might bée ſaid to the contrary. And thus wée ſée how hée diſcharged his duetie, becauſe he was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſent to bée a Miniſter of the worde. But héere is one ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial regard to bée had: and that is this, that hee muſt bée the redée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the worlde, and be condemned not becauſe hée preached the Goſpell, but that hée ſhoulde bée throwne downe into the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe depth, &amp; ſuffer for our cauſe, by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he beare as it were in his owne perſon all the curſes and tranſgreſſions of thoſe who deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued euerlaſting death. Wherefore, becauſe Ieſus Chriſt tooke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him this office, to beare the burden of all ſuch as haue deadly offended the Maieſtie of God, that was the reaſon why hée helde his peace. And ſo, let vs note, that when it was méete for Ieſus Chriſt to defend the doctrine of the Goſpel, and that it ſo ſtood with his office &amp; calling, he faithfully diſcharged the ſame. But when in holding his peace he plaied the part of a redéemer, as though hee was contented willingly to be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, it was not for his owne cauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he held his peace, but (as I haue alredy ſaid) for our ſakes. True it is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſpake (as we ſhal ofttimes ſée) but it was not in his owne defence, which did but ſo much the more kindle the rage and fury of the vngodly againſt himſelfe. And thus wée ſee, that it was not his meaning to eſcape death, but was contented, willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ouerthrowne, to the end he might declare that he had quite forgotten himſelfe, to diſcharge vs before God his father. Now hée neither reſpected himſelfe, his owne life, nor yet his honor: For he cared not to abide all the ſhame and ſlaunder of the world, ſo that our ſinnes might bée taken away, and we pardoned of our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. And héereupon it is ſaid, <hi>That the high Prieſt charged him by the liuing God, to tell him, whether he were Chriſt, the bleſſed ſonne of God,</hi> hée anſwered, <hi>That it was ſo:</hi> But that they ſhould ſée his Maieſtie, when it woulde bée too late for them, becauſe ſuch their dealing ſhoulde bée their deſtruction and ouerthrowe. Nowe our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte ſpake not this héere, to make the high Prieſt and his company to yéelde gently, but rather to pricke him faſter on: and as he was before full of malice &amp; crueltie, this was to make the fier to burſt out into a greater flambe, Howbeit wée haue ſaide, that Ieſus Chriſte reſpected not himſelfe, but rather
<pb facs="tcp:7663:49"/> diſcharged that office wherof he had taken the charge, which was, to be the redéemer of the world. Moreouer, we ſée heere in the firſt place, that the contemners of God, and ſuch as Satan hath altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther poſſeſſed, wyll vſe ſome coulored kind of religion: For a man would think, that the hye Prieſt dyd his dutie in charging Ieſus Chriſt by the name of the liuing God. But ſée into what a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe we are plunged, when Satan hath once blindfoulded our eyes: for he then throweth vs headlong into ſuch ſhamleſneſſe, as that we haue no more reuerence vnto God, then we are aſhamed before men. Now, this anſwere of our Lord Ieſus, giueth vs to note, that he meant to declare to <hi>Cayphas,</hi> and the reſt, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were for a time, as a man would ſay, abaſed, yet would not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> leſſen his maieſtie, but that he ſhould be alwaies taken to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only ſon of God. But yet there is one thing farther to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of: which is, for our better confirmation, that although he was thus abaſed for our ſaluation, he loſt no part of his heauenly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, but was contented that men ſhould oppreſſe him, to the end we might be fully certified, that we ſhould be founde honourable before God, becauſe that all the ſhames which we haue deſerued, ſhould be aboliſhed. And therefore, becauſe our Lord Ieſus helde his peace, and defended not his good cauſe, let our mouthes now be opened to call vpon God, as if we were iuſt: for he is our aduocat which ſpeaketh for vs: now then, becauſe our Lord Ieſus held his peace, he dyd it to this ende that he might now fréely make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for vs vnto God his father: and although we are but miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wormes, yet haue we acceſſe to God, to call famyliarly vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him &amp; w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> open mouth to chalenge him for our father. And this is it which he ment to ſhew vs, ſaying, <hi>Heereafter ſhall you ſee the ſon of man, ſitting at the right hand of the power of God.</hi> We muſt therfore let ſlip all regard which might bring with it any offence, when as we ſée our Lorde Ieſus to be thus abaſed. And let vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſée what the ende of it was: His meaning then was to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned without reſiſtaunce before the iudgment ſeat of God, that we might frankly go thither without feare. Let vs therefore in ſumme learne, that as often as we heare the paſſion of the hiſtory recited vnto vs, ſo to ſigh and grone, ſince the ſonne of God muſt néedes ſo wonderfully ſuffer for vs, as that in the meane while we tremble at his maieſtie, vntill ſuch time as he appeareth vnto
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7663:49"/> vs: and be ſo fully reſolued, that when ſoeuer he ſhal come, it ſhal make vs effectually to féele the frute which he hath purchaſed vnto vs by his death and paſſion. And beſids, let vs feare to be of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſuch as he thus threatneth, ſaying, <hi>Heereafter ſhall you ſee:</hi> For it is méete that the wicked and reprobate ſhould féele how terrible the iudgement ſeat of God is, and how great his power is to throw them headlong into hell, when as he ſetteth him ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
               <p>And when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alſo wil ſpeake of the condemnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which the wicked &amp; curſed of God ſhal abide, he ſaith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhal tremble &amp; feare at the countenaunce of his infinite maieſtie. Since the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is ſo, let vs learne to humble our ſelues before our Lord Ieſus,<note place="margin">2. Theſ. <hi>1.</hi>9.</note> let vs not looke to beholde with the eye the maieſtie which he wyll ſhew at his laſt comming, but let vs looke vpon him at this day as our King and as he is head of the Angelles and of all creatures, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him as our ſouereigne Prince: giuing vnto him that honour which to him belongeth, knowing, that ſince he is made our wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, redemption, rightuouſneſſe, and holineſſe in God his father, that to him wee muſt giue all praiſe,<note place="margin">1. Cor. <hi>30.</hi>
                  </note> and be filled with the fulneſſe which we muſt draw out of him. And therfore let vs be well adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to doo this honour vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, although we ſée not at this day his iudgment ſeat ſet vp: but let vs beholde it with the eyes of faith, and beſéeche God to inlighte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs with his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, that we may be ſtrengthened to call vpon him in the laſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ur, ſo that it may carye vs beyonde all our wittes and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, that we might ſo glorifie our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt at this day as he deſerueth. And this is the effect which we are to kéepe in minde. But as concerning that which is ſayde, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Cayphas</hi> and the Prieſtes condemned him to death, let vs learne, not to feare the obſtinate bouldneſſe of the vngodlye, and enemies of the trueth. Now, this is a very neceſſary doctrine for vs at this day: for wee ſée the mightie men of this world, with open mouth ſpeake euill of the Goſpell: yea we ſée ſome euen amidſt vs which profeſſe the Goſpel, and would be taken for people reformed, and from whom, as it ſhould ſéeme, there commeth nothing els out of their mouths but the Goſpell, who notwithſtanding lyke Deuilles incarnate, or rather lyke wylde and cruell beaſtes whom Satan poſſeſſeth, do condemne the doctrine of the Goſpell. And we néede not go ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb facs="tcp:7663:50"/> far to ſée al theſe things. Wherfore that we might be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt ſuch offences, and learne, alwaies to glorifie our God: Let Cayphas and ſuch lyke vomit out their blaſphemies as much as they luſt, and ſay that Ieſus Chriſt is worthy of death, &amp; muſt hold his peace at ſuch a poynt, becauſe it is naught. And let them alſo infect the ayre with their villanous and damnable blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies neuer ſo much: yet let vs hold vs to this ſaying of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: that although we at this day ſo falſely condemne his trueth, and ſtand in doubt of it, and that it be alſo falſified, euill ſpoken of, and turned cleane contrary to the meaning thereof, yet is he, ſtrong and mightie inough to defende it, and let vs paciently looke for his apparaunce, for our redemption. And in the meane while, let vs al learne to humble our ſelues, &amp; giue hym all the glory, ſince it was his wyll ſo to abaſe him ſelfe, and to make him ſelfe of no reputation in the world for our ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Let vs now fall downe before the maieſtie of our good God and acknowledge our offences, beſéeching him to cauſe vs more &amp; more ſo to féele them, as that wee may bee brought with true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to ſéeke for the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as behoueth vs to doo, &amp; come vnto hym lyke famiſhed &amp; hungry ſoules, &amp; make accompt, that the benefits which he hath purchaſed for vs, are not to be valued, to the end to make vs féele our ſelues to bee ſo much the more bound vnto him, that we might thereby be ſtirred vp to giue our ſelues wholy to worſhip him, and be diſpleaſed with our ſins &amp; iniquities, vntil ſuch time as we be euen aſhamed of them and that God hath mercy &amp; compaſſion vpon vs, and not ſuffer vs when we are once come vnto hym, neuer to forſake hym, but to be more and more confirmed towardes him, and not to care for what ſoeuer offences the Deuil ſhal lay before vs: and that we might in ſuch ſort perſeuer vnto the ende in the confeſſion of his Goſpell, as that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt might acknowledge and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low vs at the latter day for his Schollers. Now, that it would not onely pleaſe hym to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow vpon vs this grace. &amp;c.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S Saint <hi>Paul</hi> telleth vs that the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell is a ſauour of life vnto thoſe whom God hath called to be ſaued, and a ſauour of death vnto the reprobate which periſh: euen ſo haue wee héere alſo two notable examples ſet before vs, and worthy the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce, to ſhewe that the death and paſſion of the ſonne of God, was ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation vnto the one, and a condemnation to the other. For in the fall of <hi>Peter,</hi> wee ſée what the worke was, which muſt draw him from out the bottomleſſe death, wherinto he fell headlong. For, as
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7663:51"/> much as in hym lay, he baniſhed himſelfe the heauenly kingdome, eſtraunged him ſelfe from all hope of ſaluation, and cut hym ſelfe cleane of from the Churche, as a rotten member. And yet the death of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt was it, that muſt doo hym good, although he deſerued it not.</p>
               <p>And as for Iudas, it is ſaide, that when hee ſée our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt to be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned, he deſperatly hung himſelf. Now, he ſhould (as we haue ſaid) haue taken a good hart w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hym, to haue put his truſt in God, by reaſon of the condemnation of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: bicauſe we are pardoned by the power and vertue thereof. Howbeit, it was méete that theſe two ſpecktacles ſhould héere bee ſet before vs, to the ende we might the better know, that if we are not called by an eſpeciall grace and fauour, to bee pertakers of the fruite of the death and paſſion of the ſonne of God, it will avayle vs nothing. And therfore, it is not enough that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſuffered, without the benefit which he obtayned for vs, bée beſtowed vpon vs, &amp; we to haue the full poſſeſſion therof. And euen then are we moſt aſſured of it, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>as we are drawne vnto him by Faith. But to the end we might the more perfectly vnderſtand the matter, let vs follow the text of the Storye as it is ſet downe. It is ſayde, that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt was ſhamefully entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the houſe of Cayphas, that they ſpit in his face, buffeted him and ſlaunderouſly ſkorned him, by callinge him a Prophet. Now, all this, was to let vs vnderſtand, that what ſoeuer he ſuffered in in his owne perſon, was to deliuer and frée vs before God and his Angels. For there néedeth no ſpitting in our face, to cauſe vs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before God, ſpotted and blemiſhed, becauſe we are not onely deformed and ougly by reaſon of our ſinnes, but alſo full of abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable infections.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, we héere ſée how that the Sonne of God the derye liuely Image of his Father,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.13.</note> in whom his glorye and maieſtie ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, hath ſuffered all theſe ſhames, that wee might now appeare before God in his name to obtayne fauour and grace, and thereby acknowledge vs as his Children, being cleane voyde of all ſpots &amp; blemiſhes. And this is it which we are to conſider of, in this fyrſt place. Now let vs come to the fall of Peter. It is ſayde, <hi>That when a Mayd ſaw him,</hi> ſhe tolde him that he was one of Ieſus Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, but he denied it. And that an other Mayde tolde him the like
<pb facs="tcp:7663:52"/> tale, and he agayne denied it. Afterwarde, diuers preſſed him with it, and vrged it more vpon him, and then hée began to ſweare and curſe him ſelfe, as if he ſhould haue ſaide, I pray God I bee dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and come to naught, and the earth open and ſwallow mée vp, If I know him.</p>
               <p>Héere then we ſée how horribly and gréeuouſlye Peter fell thriſe, which ought greatly to feare vs in reading of the Story. Now, we know how zealous hee was:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 24.</note> Moreouer our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt commended him, and was called Péeter to ſignifie vnto vs the conſtancy of his faith: he was brought vp in a very good Schoole, and he had heard this doctrine taught, whoſoeuer denieth mée be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 10.33.</note> I wyll alſo denie him before my father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. And yet we ſée how he fell. And héere euery of vs hath good oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to tremble and be afearde: becauſe Peters weakneſſe was no greater then ours, if we be not holpen from aboue: wherfore, in the firſt place we ſée, how fraile we are, ſo ſoone as God taketh his hande from vs. For mention is not héere made of a ſkorner, nor of a prophane man, neither yet of one who had not taſted of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, nor that feared God, or yet reuerenced our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. But it was all cleane contrarye: becauſe there were excellent giftes in Peter.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 16.17.</note> For the ſonne of God fayde vnto him, Fleſhe and blood hath not reuealed theſe things vnto thée, but my father which is in heauen. We ſée then that the holy ghoſt was in Peter. And yet what a combat had he about the denyinge of our Lord Ieſus? yea with a ſilly Mayd. But if a man, had ſo ſpoken vnto him, or if ſome honorable perſonage had made him afeard, he might haue had ſome coulor for himſelfe, but we ſée y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a poore Mayd was enough to cauſe him forſake the hope of lyfe and ſaluation. Let vs therefore looke vpon the perſon of Péeter, and we ſhal ſée that God had néede to ſtrengthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs euery mynute of an howre, becauſe we are not els able to abide it: and although we haue laboured to come néere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his maieſtie, and that wee haue done many vertuous déedes, yet ſhall we, in the turning of an hande, be altogether chaunged, without God continueth in vs an inuincible conſtancie, &amp; therfore let vs learne to put Paules admonition in practiſe, which is this let him that thinketh he ſtandeth,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12</note> beware he falleth not. It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true, we are not able to vphold our ſelues, but let vs runne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that hath the meane to do it: and in the meane while, let vs
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7663:52"/> (as Saint Paul ſayeth in another place) walk moſt humbly: ſince it is God that giueth both to wyll and to perfourme, and that of his frée mercy and goodneſſe. For thus it is ſayde, make an ende of your ſaluation in feare and in trembling: as if he ſhould haue ſayd, put a part from you all preſumption and negligence Now, when wee ſée how many wayes we haue néede of Gods helpe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12.</note> is it not good reaſon that we ſhould ſtand vpon our garde, and not preſume any whit of our owne ſtrength, but carefully night and daye call vpon him, and put our ſelues into his keeping and gouernment. And we are beſides to weigh and conſider, that although the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations be not great, yet wold they ſoone oppreſſe vs, if God of his grace dyd not helpe, and remedy them. And they who thinke them ſelues moſt bould, when they are farre from blowes, become euen lyke white lyuered ſouldiers, if there blow neuer ſo ſmall a wind. In very déede if God aſſiſt vs, we are ſure to ſtande faſt, although there ariſe neuer ſo great tempeſtes. For we vnderſtande by the ſimilitude which our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte bringeth in that if an houſe bee buylt vpon a rock, although there come neuer ſo great rage of winds and waters, yet will it ſtand faſte: But that which is built vpon the ſand wyll haue a great fall and ſoone decay. So then when we ſhall be built vpon God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.24.</note> and that hee ſhall holde vs with his mighty hand, we may very well abide great and ſtout a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmes: But if there were no enemye at all to fighte againſt vs, yet ſhoulde wee bee ſoone ouerthrowne, if God once holde hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe farre from vs, and taketh from vs his hande as wee haue ſéene by Peter.</p>
               <p>But hee hath done a great deale worſſe, for hee denyed not our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt for once, but as often as hee was aſked the queſtion. We ſée, that hee forced not to paſſe continually from euill to worſe, as to fall to curſing, whenas he prayd God that hée would curſe him, and ſwallow him vp into the pyt of Hell. And therfore when wee ſée this, let vs vnderſtand, that hee whiche fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, whenas he had moſt néede to ſtande vp, will throw him ſelfe continually downe into a greater depth of deſtruction, yea euen vnto his vtter ouerthrow for euer, without God helpe to remedy him. Thus we ſée what our eſtate and condition is: for euen from the beginning it is a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der to ſee how we flatter our ſelues of our owne ſtrength and therefore our Lord Ieſus ſheweth vs by proofe
<pb facs="tcp:7663:53"/> that it is nothinge, and that whenſoeuer there bloweth neuer ſo litle a winde, we are ſoone ouerthrowne. And yet wee perſwade our ſelues, that we are able to ſtand as of our ſelues: But we doo but al this while encreaſe our owne ſorrow, adding ſinne to ſinne, and excéede more gréeuouſly in wickedneſſe. If Saint Peter had bene te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted an hundred times, in a day, he would haue denied Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte an hundred tymes, and a thowſande in the head of it. Loe in what caſe he had bene, if God had not had compaſſion vpon him: but he ſpared hym, and woulde not proue him any further. Surely, theſe thrée fals which are heere ſpoken of, are euen enow to ſhew vs an horrible example, and to make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> haires of our head ſtand vpright, to ſée peter ſo forget him ſelfe the third time, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a very beaſt in the denying of his ſaluation. But ouer and beſides this, wee are to marke that if hee had bene troubled with any other temptations, hee woulde none otherwiſe haue reſiſted them, and that had bene to haue caſt him to the déepeſt place of hell, if God had not ſo greatly fauoured him.</p>
               <p>And thus wee ſée what profyt wee are to prick out of this doctrine. Now, we heare not theſe thinges, to the ende we ſhould iudge Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and condemne his cowardlyneſſe. Yet may we in trueth iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe it: But yet by the way, wee muſt in the firſt place learne, that in knowing our weakeneſſe, we might likewiſe vnderſtande that there is nothing in vs, and not be proudlye puffed vp, by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to our ſelues through a vaine and fooliſhe opinion, any power or ſtrength. And in the meane while, let vs alſo know, that for ſo much as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuil hath ſo many waies, to deuiſe our deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he wil ſoone compaſſe vs, ſéeing S. Peter fel whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there was no ſhew of it. And beſides, let vs at laſt vnderſtande that our Lord Ieſus hath compaſſion vpon vs, when hee will not ſuffer vs to bée tempted aboue our ſtrengthes. For it is certayne, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miſchiefe wyll be ſo much the more ſéene, and we ſhall vnderſtand that after we haue committed one offence, wee ſhall be ready to redouble it, and neuer haue ende, except he, through his goodneſſe holde vs in. And thus we ſee all the thinges whiche héere are to bee obſerued. But by the way it is ſaide,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke.</hi> 22.61.</note> 
                  <hi>That after Peter heard the Cock crowe</hi> and (as S. Luke reciteth it) after that Ieſus Chriſt had looked vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, <hi>he went out and wept bitterly.</hi> Vpon this concluſion, it is ſhewed vs (as I haue before ſaid) that the death and paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt had preſently brought forth her effect &amp; power,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7663:53"/> for ſo much as Peter was rayſed vp from ſo horrible a fall. For, was not this a miracle, that God ſhould haue compaſſion on him, and that he had already obtayned mercy, after hee had committed ſo deteſt able a falt? we haue ſayde that it could not bée excuſed by ignoraunce, as if it had bene a ſmall falt? to denye Ieſus Chriſte: for it was ſaide, and tolde him, that if he rendered not a reaſon and a teſtimony of his faith before men, he was worthy to bee altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther raſed from before the Angelles of God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke.</hi> 9.26.</note> and his name blotted out of the booke of lyfe: and yet he made no reckoning to redéeme this miſerable and tranſitory lyfe, with ſo villanous and ſtraunge a denyal: not being called to come before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudges. He was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely queſtioned withall, for it was but a Mayde that ſpoke to him: and if they had dealt ſomewhat more roughlye with hym, the very worſt had béene this, they woulde haue but ſcourged and beaten him lyke a miſerable wretched caytife. And yet he ſtyl for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the feare of God.</p>
               <p>Wherfore, when we ſée this, let vs ſo much the more thinke of our ſelues, that it muſt néedes be that God would powre out the infinite treaſures of his goodneſſe, whenas he made Peter to be a pertaker of the fruite of the death and paſſion of his ſonne. Héere is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a myracle, to cauſe vs all to be in an admiration, that Peter obtayned forgiueneſſe for ſo hainous an offence: as appeareth by his repentance. For this is moſt ſure, that if a man be touched to the quicke, after hee hath fallen, and wéepeth and growneth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God for his pardon, it is a token that God hath already recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him, and reconciled him vnto him ſelfe. For repentaunce, is a ſinguler gift procéeding from the holy Ghoſt, ſhewing vs that god is mercyfull vnto vs, &amp; would not haue vs to periſh, but draweth vs vnto him ſelf. And this we ſée to be in Peter: wherfore it folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the death and paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was already available vnto him, after a wonderful maner, as hath bene before ſaide. But let vs héere in the firſt place note, that S. Peter aboad ſtill ſleepy and blockiſhe, vntill ſuch time as he perceiued the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken which our Lord Ieſus had tolde him of, to wit, that the Cock ſhould not crow till he had denied him thriſe, or els that the Cocke ſhould not crow the ſecond time, before Peter had made his thrée denials. Since then it is ſo, if our Lord Ieſus Chriſt had not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned him, he had ſtoode ſtyff in his ſin, &amp; bene plunged alwaies in deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, knowing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we had neede to be ſtil called vpon whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>as
<pb facs="tcp:7663:54"/> we haue commited any offence. For if God ſhould take away his grace from vs, &amp; not exhort vs to turne vnto him, without doubte, Satan would preuent vs, and al our ſences would become block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, ſo that we ſhould haue no one good motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to returne into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way of ſaluation. And this is it which we are ouer &amp; beſides, to beholde in the perſon of Peter. But when S. Luke telleth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ieſus Chriſt looked on him, we are héereby the better taught, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is not enough that we be pricked forward, and be pulled by the eare to returne vnto God, but Ieſus chriſt muſt alſo caſt his looke &amp; countenance vpon vs. Now, this is true, that he ſpeaketh not heere, but of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> looke of the eyes: but although our Lord Ieſus be not conuerſaunt w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> vs in a viſible maner: yet without doubt, vntil ſuch time as he caſteth his eie vpon vs, we ſhal be altogether dulled in our ſinnes, &amp; neuer think ether of wéeping or groning, &amp; although wee haue prouoked the wrath of God, &amp; although he hath bent his bow, and drawn his ſword, yet wyll we ſtill be negligent, vntil ſuch time as our Lorde Ieſus chriſt cauſeth vs to féele y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath not forgotten vs, &amp; would not haue vs periſh, but wyll draw vs out of deſtruction. And to proue this to be ſo, we dayly heare Sermons, by which we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to repentaunce: but how are we touched with them? nether were there euer, any mo admonitions: and beſides, doo not al the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> creatures of God ſtirre vs vp to come vnto him? ſurelye, if there were but one drop of wiſdome in our mindes, would not the very riſing of the Sunne call vs to an acknowledgement of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God. And beſides, if we beholde how the earth and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doo their duties, and the beaſtes and trées theirs, this were enough to ſhew vs that we muſt ſubmit our ſelues vnto his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, to the end he might be gloryfyed in vs: and yet we thinke no whit at all of it. But the Cock may crow as lowde as hee luſt, and not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cocke alone, but God alſo cauſeth al his creatures both in heauen and earth to crye out, to exhort vs to come vnto him: and that which is more, he vouchſafeth to open his holy mouth both by his law, Prophets, &amp; Goſpel, and ſaieth vnto vs, returne vnto mee O yée people: and yet we ſée our ſelues to be ſo dull and blockiſh, as is monſtrous. And therefore our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt muſt looke vpon vs with his eye of mercy, as hée dyd vpon Péeter, that he might draw out of vs true gronings, to be witneſſes of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce. For, where it is ſaide, that Peter wept bitterly, it was
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7663:54"/> to this ende to declare vnto vs the ſorrow whereof Saint Paul ſpeaketh, that is to ſaluation, and therefore we ſhould not flye it,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10.</note> but ſéeke after it &amp; although we naturally deſyre to be continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in pleaſure, and to féele no croſſe, yet muſt we be brought to bee ſorrowfull, for when God afflicteth vs, our hartes muſt néedes bée gréeued in that we haue offended him: for this ſorrow bringeth vs to quietnes, &amp; maketh vs to reioyce both before God &amp; the Angels. And we ſhall anone ſée that Iudas repented him, but it was after another and diuers maner. But we finde by Peters wéeping, that he was greatly diſpleaſed with his ſinne, and returned forthwith vnto Ieſus Chriſt. We are alſo to note, <hi>that he went out to weepe.</hi> Surely, this procéeded of weakneſſe, becauſe he was a fearde that the company ſhould ſée him repent. But be as be may, no doubt of it when he wept by him ſelfe, it was a good token that hee was touched with his ſinne and offence: becauſe he ſought not to haue men to be witneſſes of his repentance, but wept alone before God. And in this we ſée what it is for vs to doo: for if we onely bewaile our ſinnes and tranſgreſſions in the ſight of men, by this we ſhew our hypocryſie: but when we withdraw our ſelues from company and examine our ſinnes and offences, and be then ſorrowfull, that argueth that we are no hypocrites, but that we know who is our Iudge, and doo there beſéech him of pardon and forgiuneſſe, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo that it is the office of God, to pull all damned ſoules out of the pitte of hell. And this is the ſumme which wee are to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of that whiche is héere mentioned, of Peters fall, and of the thrée denialles, by which hee deſerued to bee cleane cut of from the Kingdome of God, if ſo bee Ieſus Chriſt had not ſtretched out the power of his death &amp; paſſion, to bring him to repentaunce, as héere it came to paſſe, now, it is ſaide anone after, <hi>that the Prieſtes and gouernours tooke counſell to condemne hym:</hi> But becauſe they had no power to doo it, they brought him manacled and bound vnto Pontius Pilate, the gouernour of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Country, who had authoritie, After this, it is ſaid in the Goſpel, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iudas repented him, when he ſée y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ieſus Chriſt was condemned, and caſt them the mony, which he had receued for a reward, for his treachery, &amp; therw<hi rend="sup">t</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed his falt. Howbeit, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prieſts would not receiue the mony, but bought a field of a Potter, wherin was potters earth, which ſerued to none other purpoſe, for it was good, neither for tyllage nor ſéede.
<pb facs="tcp:7663:55"/> And this Fielde they bought to burye the dead bodies: whiche they did vnder a coulor of deuotion: for they ſaide it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to put that ſiluer among the offerings of the temple. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the Euangeliſt ſayeth, that that which the Prophet had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of was accompliſhed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the thirtie pence which the children of Iſraell valued God at, might bee beſtowed vpon a potters yarde. Héere we are to conſider of that which hath bene before ſpoken, to wit, that the death and paſſion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt is not effectuall to all men, becauſe it is a ſpeciall grace whiche God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth vpon his choſen, whenas hee toucheth them by his holy ſpirit, and although they fal, yet lifteth he them vp agayne, yea &amp; though they ſtray lyke wandring ſhéepe, yet gathereth he them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether agayne, and giueth them his hand to bring them to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fould. For wee ſée how Iudas was cleane raſed out from amongſt the number of Gods Children, and therfore it was méete his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſhould bee ſéene and layde wide open before the face of the whole worlde. And ſo let vs learne (as we haue already ſaid) alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to acknowledge the ineſtimable goodneſſe of our God. For as he hath declared his loue vnto mankynde, when hee ſpared not his onely begotten ſonne, but put him to death for ſinners: Euen ſo declareth he vnto vs the eſpecall loue he beareth vs, whenas he toucheth vs with the acknowledging of our ſinnes by his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and cauſeth vs to grone, that wee might bee brought vnto him by true repentaunce.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, the entraunce whiche wee haue to come vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, commeth not from our ſelues, but becauſe that God gouerneth vs, &amp; pleaſeth to ſhew his choice. Now, theſe circumſtaunces are greatly to be noted: wee ſée that Iudas who was one of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt his Diſciples, wrought myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in his name: and yet what became of him? let vs learne care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to feare and walke, and ſubmit our ſelues wholye vnto our God: &amp; beſéeche him, not to ſuffer vs ſo ſhamefully to fall, as dyd this miſerable man. And agayne, let vs alſo beſéech him, that if we ſhal fal at any time into the like, to lift vs vp by his power, that we may returne vnto him: not with ſuch repentaunce as Iudas dyd, but with a true and right confeſſion. For, the wicked as it is ſaid by the prophets Ieremiah and Ezechiel, will laugh God to ſkorne as much as is poſſible: becauſe they take pleaſure, &amp; glory in their
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7663:55"/> ſinns, and in the end become lyke ſhameles whores. But yet God at the laſt maketh them to féele their ſinnes, and ſo terrifieth them as that they chafe and cry out alas: neuertheleſſe, they doe not thus of any hope they haue neither doe they preſent them ſelues before God: But are rather puſhed forward with a fury: and flye from him as farre they can, and woulde bee glad to pluck him out of his thorne by the eares. For there is no ſpeaking to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe they are angry, and rebelliouſly whet their téeth againſt him. Howbeit we muſt be brought to another kinde of repentaunce: whiche is, we muſt not become like wilde and ſauage beaſtes, ſéeing we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eſcape the hande and heauy iudgement of God: but let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe our ſinne, and abhorre it, and ſtil draw néere vnto God, with out enforcement: and worſhip him willingly, &amp; confeſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> we are worthy of deſtruction: but yet let vs be aſſured, that although we are guilty of an hundred thouſand deathes, that hee will alwayes haue compaſſion on vs, for we ſée how Peter repented. But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce of Iudas ought to ſhewe vs, that it is not enough that we féele our ſinnes, bt we muſt be fully brought home vnto God. And this is a very notable thing to conſider: becauſe we ſée that a great number, and almoſt all men doo flatter themſelues: for they thinke, that if they haue in worde acknowledged their offences, be they neuer ſo haynous, that they are cleane diſcharged of them, as if their mouthes were fully cleanſed. Agayne if a man be earneſt with them, they think they are offered great wronge. What? ſaye they, haue I not confeſſed my falts? and haue I not repented me? And this is al the reckoning that they make of it: as if God were a yong child who would be appeaſed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a ſmiling &amp; diſſembling cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, ful of leaſing &amp; hipocryſy. Howbeit this is our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for we would appeaſe god we know not how: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it is ſaid with ſuch a repentance as Iudas repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted. Wherfore, let vs feare and tremble when God giueth vs warning, &amp; cauſeth vs to féele our ſins, &amp; not ſtay altogether vpon it: for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is no true repentance: but this is the true triall by which we muſt know whether we be true penitent ſinners or not: which is, whenas we of our owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, ſéeke to be at peace with God, &amp; forſake not his iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, yea, ſeing he receiueth vs to mercy. Which, he wil do whenas we ſhal condem our ſelues: for whſoeuer ſhal be his own iudge, &amp; conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne himſelf before God, &amp; before Angels, &amp; men, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man I ſay, ſhall bée iuſtified &amp; pardoned, becauſe hee deſyreth none other thing but to
<pb facs="tcp:7663:56"/> haue God mercyfull vnto him. This then is the ſumme and effect of that which we are héere to obſerue. Now, Iudas muſt néedes make this confeſſion, becauſe the prieſts might be ſo much y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more without excuſe. The Euangeliſt likewiſe maketh this recital, that we might the better behold how Satan had blinded al theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates: and that euery of vs might looke narowly into himſelfe. And when God ſetteth before vs ſuch exampels of his yre &amp; ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and (to be ſhort) that we, like men betwitched, and voyd of ſence &amp; reaſon, become ſo beaſtly, as to throw our ſelues headlonge into an helliſhe furie: This is to make euerye of vs to ſtoupe, and to cauſe vs know that wee may oftentimes fall into the ſame were if not that our God preſerueth vs by his grace and goodneſſe. But by the way let vs beware that we fight not agaynſt our own conſciences, as the prieſtes did: for as many as ſo harden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt God, ſhal in the end fall into ſuch a reprobate ſence, as that they ſhall be cleane without all reaſon: for, after they haue once ſo excéeded againſt GOD, they will alſo bee paſt all ſhame before men. For it is good reaſon that the whole worlde ſhould ſée their beaſtlineſſe, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there ſhamleſnes ſhould be ſo knowne, as that euery man might abhorre their villanie. Héere then wee ſée why the Euangeliſt maketh this recitall, that when Iudas came to reſtore the ſiluer, the prieſtes were no whit moued therewith. Indéede, they ſayde it was not lawfull to put it into the treaſury, becauſe it was the price of blood. And héere alſo we may ſée, that hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrits will alwaies be ſure to haue ſome fine ſhifttes or other, to ſhadow and couer their iniquities, but it is all to mock God: For they neuer come perfectly and ſoundly vnto him. For, what is this to ſay, ho, ſurely we wyll neuer put this ſiluer amongſt the holye offerings, becauſe it is the price of blood. Now, I pray you tel mée, from whence came this ſiluer? truly, we know this, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prieſts liued vpon the offerings of the temple: as at this day, they whiche in popery, are called prelats and churchmen, glottonouſly conſume the offrings, and neuer care to what vſe they put them. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Prieſts took from the oblations of the temple, the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer which they gaue to Iudas, they neuer cared, nor yet reſpected it: &amp; now they make a doubt to put y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſiluer againe into the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurie. But by your leaue, they thruſt back Iudas as it were after a ſcoffing maner, &amp; as if they ſhould haue ſayd, now ſir, this villaine
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7663:56"/> hath betraied his maiſter, &amp; it is no matter to vs whether he hath done well or yll: neuertheleſſe, becauſe we for our partes wyll not be pertakers of his offence, and make cleane handes of it (becauſe they had beſtowed this mony to ſuch an vſe) wee will buy a fielde with it to bury ſtraungers in. As who ſhould ſay, that they had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied God well enough, &amp; that hee coulde deſire no more at their handes, although they had offended in that thing which they dyd. Thus we ſée, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hypocrits will be ſure to haue wherewith to make ſatiſfaction, and ſo thinke by this meane to buy out them ſelues: howbeit theſe are but childiſh toyes. Neuertheleſſe, let vs vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that this thing is ſet downe vnto vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we might know, that when we haue fallen, we ſhould acknowledge our falts indéede, and not goe about the buſh this way and that way, but wholy and fréely condemn our ſelues, &amp; this is it, which we are héere ſhewed. But in the meane while, let vs beſéech the Lorde to take away the wymples wherwith Satan goeth about to blindfould vs, that wée ſtand not ſtiffe in our flatteries, therby to excuſe our naughtines, and let vs more and more make a good tryall to condemne all our ſins, &amp; confeſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> truly. Moreouer, we ſée alſo how god ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eth the opinion of hypocrits, ſo that in the end they are cleane put by, their pretended purpoſe. For, the prieſts woulde gladly haue blotted out their offence, that it might neuer haue come in queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe: and this was their pretence, whenas they bought a field to bury ſtraungers in But God turned all quite and cleane againſt their meaning: for the Field was to be called the bloodye, &amp; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering field, euerlaſtingly to remaine in the mouthes of men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children: ſo that this deteſtable falt whiche the prieſtes committed, might be daylye made knowne and manifeſted, that it might bee ſaide, this is the bloody fielde, which was bought with the price of treaſon. And who were they that dyd it? Forſooth, euen the prieſtes and heads of the people.</p>
               <p>So then we ſée, that when hypocrits go about to hide and muffle their miſdéeds, then God ſo much the more diſcouereth their villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and cauſeth all men to knowe, and abhorre theyr deteſtable ſhamleſneſſe. And héere wee ſée the reaſon why wee haue ſaide, that we ought ſo much the more aduiſedlye to come vnto God, &amp; lay open our ſinnes, which is to this ende, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it would pleaſe him to
<pb facs="tcp:7663:57"/> bury the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euen in the ſight of himſelf, of his Angels, and of the whol world, whenas we, for our partes haue thus acknowledged them. And in the end, the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſt alledgeth one place out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophet, to ſhew, that this is not only recited becauſe of Iudas ſin, &amp; of the diueliſh obſtinacie of the prieſts, but for the condemnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of all the people in generall. For there it is ſaid, that that which was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Prophete was accompliſhed, That God was valued at thirtie péeces of ſiluer,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zach.</hi> 11.13</note> &amp; the ſame was caſt into the Potters fielde, now Zachariah, out of whom this place is taken, compareth our Lord Ieſus vnto a ſhepheard, &amp; ſaith that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he meant to gouern the people of the Iewes, he tooke his ſtaffe or ſhepheards crooke cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led beautie, that he might be able to ſay, that the eſtate of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was ſo wel appointed as was poſſible, if it could haue byn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to haue byn guyded by the hand of God. And could they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire any thing more? Now to prooue that this is true, I pray you what great ioy &amp; felicity could we haue, if God were not careful o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs, &amp; playd the part of a ſhepheard amongſt vs. And thus we ſée what a gouernment God vſed ouer this people, whenas this wand is ſpoken of, and not of a ſtaffe to lay on them and vtterly to bruiſe them, but to guide &amp; gouerne the ſhéepe peaceably which were tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable &amp; teacheable. Howbeit it is ſaid that he tooke a wand the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, as indéed, when the people returned from the captiuity of Babylon, God thruſt himſelfe into the office of a ſhepheard: For after ſo horrible an ouerthrow as was before, he gathered the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple together, that he might peaceably gouerne them vnder his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. But in the end they dealt ſo vnthankfully with him, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he could not chooſe but cléerely forſake them. And therfore he ſaid Ah <hi>Sirrha</hi> I ſée wel ynough howe it fareth with you: and I doe nothing els but loſe both my time and trauel amongſt you. And there he ſpake after the maner of men. Well, goe to now, diſpatch me at once, &amp; pay me, that I were gone And thervpon they brought him thirtie péeces of ſiluer. What quoth hée, is this the rewarde &amp; pay which I ſhall haue of you? For when hée ſpake of the thirtie pence, hée had reſpect vnto the oblations that were offered in the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For as they hypocritically vſed them without faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce) they were no better then vayne ceremonies and yet notwithſtanding the Prieſtes made great accompt of them.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:7663:57"/>
               <p>And after this ſorte, deale the Papiſtes at this daye, for when they haue made a great number of whim whames, and glorious deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they by &amp; by think that God is as a man would ſay greatly behoulden to them. Now, God ſayeth for all this, that they are but apiſh toyes. For, ſayeth he, what haue I got by you? yée ſée wel enough that I haue but a Shepheardes paye, and yée think I am bound vnto you for it. Tuſh, tuſhe, it is nothing ſo, for I haue no néede of it: goe your wayes and caſt it into the Potters houſe, &amp; fill vp your holes and cranies therewith: go your waies I forgiue you, and beſtow it on your Potters clay. As if he ſhould haue ſaid, If you like to haue it in your temple, ſtuffe that with it? For I wil haue no part nor portion with you, and wil rydde my hands clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of it: and think not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I wyll be contented in bringing me héere as it were trifles for pay: for be you aſſured that I lyke not of any of all this geare. And this is the ſumme and effect which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ment hereby. Now, we know that, that which was then fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde of our God, was fulfilled in the perſon of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, who is our very God manifeſted in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Wherefore it muſt néedes be that this place ſhould be veryfied by a viſible manner, and that Ieſus Chriſt ſhoulde bee valued at thirtie pence onely, that is to ſaye,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16.</note> the people very vnthankfullye dealt with him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom God had appoynted to bee the euerlaſtinge Shepheard of this people. And this is moſt certaine, that becauſe the people could not abide that God ſhoulde bee their Gouernour, yet our Lorde Ieſus hath alwaies played the office of a mediator, although he neuer ſhewed him ſelfe in our humane nature. And this is it which we ought héere ſtill to remember, to the ende that we for our partes might learne, ſéeinge that God hath bene ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable vnto vs to gather vs together as it were vnder his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, and to take vs to be of his fould, and deliuereth vnto vs our Lord Ieſus Chriſt for our ſhepherd, let not vs in ſuch ſort wound him, as to gréeue his ſpirit through our rebellious and vnthankful dealing, and not pay him (as we ſaye) with nifles and trifles, but let vs take him for our God and Kinge, ſince he hath pleaſed ſo to vouchſafe it, and conſecrate our ſelues vnto him all the dayes of our lyfe, and not pay hym with counterfet coyne, but yéelde vnto him both our bodies and ſoules. For it is good reaſon that wee ſhould yéelde vnto him all gouernment ouer vs, and we to be only
<pb facs="tcp:7663:58"/> his, ſéeing he ſéeketh onely our ſaluation. Now to conclude it is ſayd that when our Lorde Ieſus was brought before Pylate hee made no anſwer, and that Pylate aſked him, ſaying, <hi>why ſpeakeſt thou not? doeſt not thou ſee that theſe men witneſſe againſt thee?</hi> and that he held his peace, inſomuch that the Iudge wondered at hym. Now, wee are héere in the firſt place to call to minde, that when our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt appeared before an earthly Iudge, it was to this ende, that we might be deliuered from the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which we haue deſerued to féele,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.23.</note> before the heauenly Iudge. For we know that we cannot goe from that which is ſpoken of, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet Iſaiah, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery knée muſt bowe before the maieſtie of God. And therefore, ſince God is the Iudge of the whole world how is it poſſible that wee can ſtande before his face? for there is none of vs all, but muſt needes be enforced to ſay, that we are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be condemned an hundred thouſand times. And although we haue lyued but one yeare, yet haue we committed an hundred thouſand faults, which deſerue euerlaſting condemnation, and is ſo engraued in our hartes as that we cannot denie it. Wherefore, ſince God is clearer ſighted then we, how can it bee that he ſhould not condemne vs, ſéeing euery of vs muſt néedes in ſundrye wiſe condemne hym ſelfe? howbeit we ſée our Lord Ieſus Chriſt to bée driuen to this extremitie, as that he was accuſed before an earthly Iudge, and ſo prophane a man, as that there was nothing in hym but couetuouſneſſe and ambition. And therefore ſince the ſonne of God was brought thus lowe, it was to this ende that wee might vnderſtand and know that wee might bouldlye preſent our ſelues before the maieſti of God, for the receiuing of vs, ſo that we ſhould neuer néede to feare couragiouſly to come before his tribunal ſeat, becauſe we are ſure that he wyll haue mercy vpon vs. Moreouer, we know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ieſus Chriſt hath power, authoritie, &amp; dominion to be Iudge ouer the whole world: and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when Pylate had thus conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, it was to this end that we might bouldly come vnto him, becauſe we know, that he ſhall come to be our Iudge. And againe, that we might vnderſtand, becauſe he held his peace, that his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was to abide to be condemned for vs, and not anſwere for his iuſtification, ſince hee knewe hee muſt bee condemned for our ſakes. For although he was without fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, yet bare hee all our ſins vpon him. And therfore it is no wonder though he helde his peace,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7663:58"/> and were ouercome: for otherwiſe hee could not haue performed the office of a Mediator, without he had bene condemned, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that he was worthy to dye for our cauſe. And this is the mea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning why our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt held his peace, that wee might with open mouth call vpon God, and beſéech him of pardon for all our ſins and tranſgreſſions.</p>
               <p>Let vs now fall downe before the maieſtie of our good God, and acknowledge our offences, beſéeching him to touch vs vnfeynedly and to the quick, that wee might grone and wéepe before him for the ſame. And although they be great and gréeuous, yet that hee would not ſuffer vs to be deſperately ſhut out, but to bee alwayes ſubiect &amp; runne vnto him. And forſomuche as of our ſelues we are blockiſh, and ſhall be neuer able to attayne thereto, let vs beſéeche hym to looke vpon vs with his eye of mercye, as hee hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt to haue care ouer vs, as a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harde hath ouer his Shéepe, that he woulde alſo ſo gather vs vnto himſelfe, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we folow not the war of deſtruction from the which he hath pulled vs, but walke in that good way, wherinto hee hath brought vs. Let vs alſo beſéeche him ſo to continue vs in it, as that we prouoke not his heauy wrath againſt vs, and therby forſake vs for being any longer our Shepherd: But to defend vs with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and grace, and offer vp ſuch ſacryfices vnto him, as that wee might know that he hath not loſt his labour in gouerninge of vs, but that we might anſwere his holy calling. And for ſomuch as it hath pleaſed him to draw vs vnto him, and ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.15.</note> but yet no earthly Prince: for we ſée, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Iewes would haue crowned him, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew himſelfe and hid him in a mountaine: and thereby he cut the throate of this ſlaunder, becauſe he ſhould haue made the Goſpel to haue béen euil ſpoken of if he had peruerted the politike order and gouernment of the world. For be that came to call vs all to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen and to make vs partakers therof, meant not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh earthly kingdoms, ſéeing they are vpholden by him, and his power. And therfore it was not méet that the Goſpell ſhould carry with it any ſuch blame, as that Ieſus Chriſt was come to vſurpe any worldly power, or authoritie. And héere we ſée why he namely
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7663:60"/> ſaieth vnto Pylate that his kingdome was not of this world. And to ſay the trueth, what were it, and if the kingdom of Ieſus Chriſt were earthly. For what ſhould we get by putting our truſt in him,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19.</note> when as we ſée our eſtate to be ſo miſerable in the worlde. Truely the very Infidels are in better caſe then we, conſidering the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which we muſt abide. In déede it is true that God ſendeth his ſcourges ouer the face of the whole earth; and they which deſire as much as is poſſible to be freed from them, ſhal neither will nor chooſe but be ſubiect to a number of miſeries and afflictions. And yet for al this, we ſhal alwayes be more roughly handled: For God muſt firſt begin, to chaſtiſe his owne houſe and Church. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if our Lord Ieſus had béen an earthly King, it ſhoulde ſéeme that we were méere ſtraungers vnto him.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, let it bée that wée had all the pleaſures in the world, and that by the meane of the Sonne of God, wée were héere as in a Paradiſe, yet ſhoulde our life bée but a ſhadowe, and our fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie verie ſhort, and tranſitorie. And therefore, we ought ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie well to knowe, and be fully perſuaded, that the kingdome of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt is heauenly, that wée might bende our ſelues to the euerlaſting life, wherevnto wée are called. Thus we ſée, that the kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt is euerlaſting, becauſe it conſiſteth not of any thing in this corrupt worlde. Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore patiently beare all our aduerſities, conſidering, it neither di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſheth nor leſſeneth the grace which our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt hath obteined for vs: for they are eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo many helps to our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Paule witneſſeth.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.28.</note> And when the worlde ſhall deſpiſe and mocke vs, &amp; we ſuffer many ſlanders, abide hunger, and thirſt, drawe our legges after vs, and be harried on euerie ſide, yet muſt we haue this conſideration, that God accepteth of vs. And this is, as if hée chocked vs by the thinne, and ſaide, Looke vp a ſoft, and ſet not your mindes vpon theſe worldly matters. This then is the ſumme which wée are héere to obſerue. And to ſay the trueth, it is not without cauſe that our Lorde Ieſus ſpake ſo confidently, that hée was borne and came into the worlde to ſay the trueth: and that whoſoeuer woulde haue any good taſte, ſhoulde ſtay him ſelfe vpon his worde.

And let vs, of all that which we ſée to bée the verie ſummarie of the Goſpell, note well this ſaying, That Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt came into the world to ſpeake the trueth: to the end we might herevpon conclude, that whenſoeuer we ſhall giue diligent eare vnto his worde, that it ſhall not be in vaine: becauſe this is a certaine &amp; reſolute concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that whatſoeuer he had giuen them the choyſe either of Ieſus, or Barabbas, who (as S. Iohn ſaith) was a théefe:<note place="margin">

Now, this was a deteſtable peſtelence of al others: and yet the people cryed out, <hi>Let vs haue Barabbas,</hi> and let him be pardoned, and Ieſus Chriſt crucified. By this cuſtome of letting looſe a priſoner at Eaſter, we ſée with what fooliſh deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons men are carried. For they thought the feaſt to be ſo muche the more honourable, in the looſing of a priſoner, and that they did God great ſeruice: and yet all was verie abhominable: For it is ſaide, That he that iuſtifieth the wicked,<note place="margin">

For his meaning is, that they ſhould haue a fatherly care ouer the people, and to be verie warie how they lift vp them ſelues cruelly, to wrong others, by abuſing of their credit and authoritie, but would haue them rather be gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and pitifull. Yet muſt they puniſh wickedneſſe, for God ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth them. But what do we men? Forſooth, we think we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the feaſt of Eaſter, when as we offende God, and manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tranſgreſſe his worde. By this wée are admoniſhed not to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe our owne fantaſies, when the matter concer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And here we ſée what ariſeth vpon this kinde of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, to wit, that we make lawes accordingly at this day: ſo that whatſoeuer is receiued for a common order, ſéemeth to be lawfull. And yet howſoeuer it ſéemeth to vs, God vtterly condemneth it. Nowe, wee ſée what abuſe hath come heerein, which is this, that this corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath made Barabbas to be preferred before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne of God. A man here would at the firſt ſight thinke it very ſtraunge that our Lord Ieſus ſhould be thus lightly eſtéemed of, and a théefe and murderer greatlier priuiledged then he: that he, ſhoulde finde ſuch fauour &amp; grace amongſt men, &amp; Ieſus Chriſt to be ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully &amp; ſlanderouſly handled. For, was it not enough that the ſonne of God was crucified, &amp; aboad a moſt ſla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derous kind of death, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out he muſt alſo be greatly tormented. The death of the croſſe was but as a puniſhment for théeues: &amp; it was not onely, as at this day the gallowes ſhould be, but it was as if he ſhould haue abidden the whéele. Was it not then enough, that after Ieſus Chriſt had béen buffeted, &amp; ſpetted on, &amp; brought euen downe to the pitte of hell, but that he muſt in compariſon be ſhewed to be accurſed of al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world? For, if we ſhould iudge of it according to natural reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the outward ſhew, ſurely we ſhould be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>founded, but we muſt lift vp the eies of faith a great deale higher, &amp; come vnto that which before we haue ſaid: to wit, that all this was gouerned by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> counſel of God And therfore let vs not ſtand vpon that which the people, &amp; Pylate did, but let vs behold y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnchangeable decrée of God: which is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for the better humbling of vs, his wil was to haue his Sonne ſo ſhamefully to be caſt down, yea to be caſt vnder the féete of al the malefactors of the world: béeing crucified betwéene two théeues, as hereafter ſhalbe ſeene. We ſée the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what it is for vs to obſerue, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is here ſaid that Barabbas muſt be let loſe, and Ieſus Chriſt bée made the moſt abhominable man of the world Yet for all this, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late went about to haue deliuered our Lord Ieſus: but it was by a deuiliſh meane, to wit, by buffeting of him (which they then called puniſhing) &amp; would haue let him gone, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had ſo puniſhed him, as one that had committed a fault: For by this he pretended to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the ſtirre of the people. Now, if our Lord Ieſus had bin thus deliuered, what had become of the Goſpell, and of the ſaluation of
<pb facs="tcp:7663:62"/> the world? For this correction which Pylate, brought him to, was a ſigne and token of diſhoneſtie for euer, as if the Goſpell had béen a wicked doctrine, conſidering, that the Iudge of the countrie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned it: and the perſon of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was clearely refuſed. And yet, had we all bin loſt, becauſe there was none other meane to reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cile vs vnto God, but by the death of his onely ſonne. And thus we ſée that the death of our Lord Ieſus, was the very o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen way vnto life. So then, we ſée that the Deuill did the beſt hée could not to haue our Lord Ieſus to dye: and yet who clapped, the Prieſtes &amp; their like, vpon the backes to purſue Ieſus Chriſt vnto death, but the Deuil himſelfe? This is very true. for hée bewitched them: &amp; as we ſée that God ſendeth the ſpirit of trouble &amp; madneſſe vpon all the vngodly, ſo that they are one againſt an other: euen as the waues of the Sea beate one an other: euen ſo was the Deuill carried, when as on the one ſide, he went about to aboliſh the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; beſides, on the other ſide, meant to hinder the redemption of mankinde. But God ſo handled y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as that the verie mouth of the Iudge ſhoulde beare witneſſe of the innocency of his ſonne: &amp; yet for all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hée hath promiſed he will perfourme. And therfore when Dauid would ſtrengthen him ſelfe againſt all temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.</note> he ſaith that the word of God was like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſiluer which had béen ſeuen times purified in the fyre. Euen ſo, as oftentimes as we doubt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> promiſes of our lord Ieſus Chriſt, and ſhal be troubled and gréeued (as that is the ſubtletie of Satan, to make vs loath our ſelues, &amp; to be out of heart.) Let vs returne vnto this teſtimony, that howeuer it is, our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt hath appeared vnto the world, that he might be a faithful witneſſe for vs: and let vs at this day be aſſured, that hée in effect ſheweth vs, that he hath not giuen vs all theſe promiſes in vaine, becauſe he will without all doubt performe them. And thus much we haue in ſumme to conſider of. Moreouer whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Pylate ſaide, <hi>What is the truth?</hi> Let vs note that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he moued this queſtion, he ſpake it not for any deſire to learne, but after a deſpightful &amp; ſcornfull manner: which is at this day, a vice that reigneth in many. For when wée ſpeak of the truth of God, we mean the doctrine of the Goſpel: And S. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo ſo calleth it,<note place="margin">Ephe. 1.13.</note> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end we might make a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce therof fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all other knowledge. In very déed if any thing be told vs which hath bin done, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is a truth: But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God calleth vs vnto him, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7663:62"/> would draw vs from this worlde, that we might come to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly life, this truth ought to be ſet in the higheſt degrée, and ſhould make no reckoning of the reſt in reſpect of it. Let vs nowe conſider how the world reuerenceth the word of the Goſpel. The wyſeſt worldlinges (for ſo they are accompted) are ſo preſumptuouſly blind, as when that is ſpoken of vnto them, will thus ſay, what I beſéech you? Haue wée liued thus many yéeres in the worlde, and doe you thinke we knowe not the Goſpel, nor any thing els. But they wil al be aſhamed whenas they ſhalbe tolde that the truth of the Goſpel hath béen buried, and that they ought to looke more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly vnto it: Now héerevpon we heare wel enough howe they ſcoffe and ieſt. And euen ſo fared it with Pylate. For becauſe the Emperour had ſent him to be his Lieutenant in the Countrey of Iudea, hée thought hée had greate wrong done him, when a man ſpake of a truth which he knew not of. What? (ſayeth hée) thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thou that wée are all fooles? and doe nothing elſe but lie? Are wée not able to diſcerne betwéene good and yll? And is it méete for thée to reprooue mée and ſay, I knowe not the trueth, who am héere ſet in office, and doe repreſent the perſon of the Emperour? Thus wée ſée the meaning of Pylate, which is, hée proudely ſwelled like a Toade, and woulde not bée ſo taken, as to bée once thought, that hée was not able to diſcerne betwéene good and bad.</p>
               <p>And indéede, we ſée that hée tarried not to heare what our Lord Ieſus woulde ſay, but caſte out theſe deſpitefull woordes, and wente his way. Since then it is ſo, let vs conſider with our ſelues, that although there bée at this day, many Pylates which refuſe to learne in the ſchoole of GOD, and to become teachea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as if they were wiſe enough, yet let not vs geue ouer ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of our ſelues vnto his obedience, but accept of that which our Lorde ſheweth and ſetteth before vs: becauſe wée knowe that the truth wil not grow vp in our mindes, by reaſon they are ful of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and leaſinges, and we plunged ouer heade and eares in darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, vntil ſuch time as God draweth vs out of it.</p>
               <p>And therfore, let vs vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the truth farre paſſeth our minds and powers, and that GOD muſte bée our Maiſter, to bring vs vnto it: &amp; wée alſo very young and féeble, to receiue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which hée ſheweth vs: and let vs holde this trueth for ſo precious a Iewell,
<pb facs="tcp:7663:63"/> as that when wée haue compaſſed both heauen and earth, &amp; thinke wée haue learned all, that it is all but ſmoke, and wil ſléete away, vntil ſuch time as we buyld vpon this moſt certaine &amp; vnchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble woorde. And this is the effect of that which héere wee are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of. Now, it is by &amp; by ſaid, <hi>That as Pilate was ſet downe in the iudgement ſeate,</hi> his wife ſent vnto him and prayed him not to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe ſhe had byn troubled with many things in her dreames<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of him. No doubt of it, it was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wil of God, diuers wayes, to teſtify of his innocencie: yea euen by Pylates owne mouth (as already hath bin ſaid, &amp; as herafter ſhalbe ſeene more at large) not but that God had concluded what ſhould become of his onely Sonne. And ſo, forſomuch as his will was that hée ſhoulde be the Sacrifice, to take away, the ſinnes of the worlde, it muſt néeds be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Scripture ſhould be fulfilled. But it muſt alſo néeds fal out y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our Lord Ieſus muſt be proued a iuſt &amp; an innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t man, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we might y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better vnderſtand that he was conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned for our ſakes, of which conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation we were guilty: &amp; that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoeuer we heare of the death and paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, wée ſhoulde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually remember our ſinnes and iniquities. Hereupon it is ſaid, <hi>That Pilate deſired to let looſe our Lorde Ieſus:</hi> For although he had the chiefeſt authority, without controlme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, yet becauſe he was in a ſtrange countrey, and amongſt a mutinous companie, yea, &amp; had a garriſon in the towne, the ſedition troubled him. And here we ſée what the cauſe was why he would ſubtilly &amp; friendly procéed in the matter, Forſooth it was by reaſon that hée would haue appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the people. Then it is ſaid, that hée offred them their auncient cuſtome, which was, <hi>That euery Eaſter hee ſhoulde let looſe vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whatſoeuer priſoner they would.</hi> For his meaning was that hée ſhould die, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacrifice, w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> ſhould be offered for our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption. God hath but one only &amp; plain wil &amp; meaning, but it is wonderful to vs, &amp; his procéedings are ſo ſtrange, that we muſt be faine to caſt down our eyes, and yet confeſſe that our Lord Ieſus hath ſuffered, but not as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would, but becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhould haue ſuch a pawne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> infinite loue of God, &amp; that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt might declare it, wherby he might ſhew how precious &amp; déer y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our ſoules are to him, &amp; therfore let vs wel co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider of al theſe thinges.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7663:63"/> to cry out the lowder, to haue him put to death. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Pilat rehearſed againe, that he heard that Ieſus was the ſonne of God: which were the wordes that touched him, and was more a fearde of that, then he was before. And marke why he aſked, whence art thou? and when Ieſus Chriſt helde his peace, knoweſt not thou (ſayeth he) that I haue power to looſe and condemne thée. Now, we ſée heere why the Iewes brought in, ſuch an accuſation againſt our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In very déede, the offence whiche might the rather moue the Gouernour of the Country, was, becauſe hee tooke vpon him a kingdome: But when they ſée that their malice was diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and that Pylat right well knewe that they were but fained leaſings, they thereupon ſaid, <hi>we haue a law by which he ought to dye.</hi> And that, they reſerued for their priuiledge, to the ende they might not reaſon about religion. For the Romaines who were prophane people, and ſerued their idols onely for faſhions ſake, would maintaine their dominion, euery man as hée was minded. And thereupon they ſaide, <hi>hee hath made him ſelfe the Sonne of God,</hi> and therefore hath he blaſphemed. It is true, that if our Lorde Ieſus had not bene the redéemer of the world, hee had bene worthy to haue dyed, for callinge of him ſelfe the onely Sonne of God: For we are all the Children of God, ſéeing hée hath adopted vs by his grace, and this is the common vaine, and phraſe of the holy ſcripture. And they which haue receiued any ſpecial grace, as Princes, and magiſtrates, are called the Sonnes of God another way.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, by a farre greater reaſon, may Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 82.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> who was perfectly anoynted with the graces and vertues of the holy Ghoſt, very well be called the Sonne of God. But if hee had not bene the redéemer of the world, and had called himſelfe, for honors ſake the onely ſonne of God, ſurely it had bene a deadlye offence. But how fell it out, that the Iewes accuſed him heereof? In the firſt place we are to note that it was for want of knowledge of the ſcriptures, becauſe they knew not that he which ſhould be the redéemer, ſhould be manifeſted, to be the liuing God. And therfore becauſe they had no knowledge of the Scripture, nor acquainted therewith but were lyke vnto brut beaſtes by reaſon of their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, ſée why they were ſo bould to condemne Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7663:64"/>
               <p>The like raſhneſſe we ſée to be in al thoſe which are ignorant. For when we ſhall at this day heare them crye, thou hereticke: they ſpeake it not becauſe they are able to proue it, but the moſt doltiſh of them are carried with ſuch a rage, as that they wyll (forſooth) he zealous, of the honour of God, and yet know why nor wherefore. Moreouer, they muſt enquire whether Ieſus Chriſt was the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, or not: howbeit the Iewes refuſed him without aſking any queſtion.</p>
               <p>By this we are to learne, that if wee will haue ſuch a zeale as God lyketh of, wee muſt bee ruled by a true knowledge and bee taught by his worde. For we may vtter whoat wordes, but they ſhall be but ſo many of Satan his rages, if we ſpeake not like the Schollers of God: becauſe hee is the onely competent Iudge, and reſerueth this office to himſelfe, to ſhewe vs, what his wyll is. Seing then it is ſo, let vs follow the word of God ſimplye, and bee quiet: and let our zeale be ruled by it, &amp; this is it which we are to obſerue in the firſt place. But when it is ſaide, <hi>That Pylate was more afearde then hee was before,</hi> when hee hearde the Sonne of God ſpoken of: heere we ſée in the perſon of a wretched pagan, that a little ſéede of religion moued and pricked him, and ſo ſolycited his conſcience as that he knewe not which way to turne him. Hée ſée Ieſus Chriſt altogether deformed, and hee him ſelfe had cauſed him to be ſcourged and he was before that very ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vſed, with ſpitting and buffeting in the houſe of Cayphas to be ſhort, a man vtterlye diſpiſed and forſaken of all men: and yet the name of God moued Pontius Pilate, and engendred in him a meruelous feare. What then ſhall we do whenas we ſhal become lyke vnto brute beaſtes. For when any man ſhal ſpeake to vs of God, if we be not ſome way kept in &amp; reſtrained, we ſhal after the example of Pylate, be condemned in the latter day, we ſhal at this day ſée ſuch deuiliſh and horrible ſkorners, that if a man ſay vnto them, beholde what God ſheweth vs, and alleadge his worde, and allow of that which they refuſe, they care not, but wyl ſtoppe their eares, hood wynke their eyes, and their myndes are otherwyſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied, and ſo proude, as that there is no ſpeaking of giuing eare: For thus they pleaſe them ſelues we are at a good poynt (ſay they) and ſo it ſhall be: It is euen ſo, yet looke vpon Pilate, who neuer had heard a word of the doctrine of God, yea he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temned the law
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7663:64"/> ſo that what ſoeuer the Iewes dyd, he thought it to be but a fonde deuiſed thing, and worſhipped his Idols: yet the name of GOD touched him, and hee conteined himſelfe thereby, whenas hée hard it ſpoken of. And did hée this for any Maieſtie or pompe that he ſée to bee in Chriſte Ieſus? No, for, the very name of God was it, that mooued him to this reuerence. What then ſhall become of them who ſhall bée condemned by this feare of Pilat, ſo long as they followe their accuſtomed maner of life, ſo that there can bee nothing wrong from them, although a man doe not onely talke vnto them of the name of God, and ſpeake as it were ſometimes glaunſingly, but offereth alſo both to teache them, &amp; point the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out with the finger, the teſtimonies of the Scripture? If they vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe not to conſider of it, nor yet giue any diligent attendance ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, muſt it not néedes bée, but that the Diuell hath altogether poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed them, and giue vs to vnderſtande that they are very mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who haue quite giuen ouer all the ſéede of Religion, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately ſet themſelues againſt God, in diſpite of nature? And this is it which we haue to conſider of. Nowe howeuer it is, wée on the contrary part alſo ſée, that whatſoeuer feare wée haue, and whatſoeuer our mindes and vnderſtanding can comprehende for the honouring of God, wyll bée like none other thing but as a bright lightning, which flaſheth in our faces, and is ſoone gone. For how did Pilate feare God, wee ſée that it ſtande him not, but ſhewed ſo great crueltie, as if God had neuer béene? Thus wée ſée, that they who are not gouerned by the ſpirite of God, ſhall on the one ſide bee ſo poſſeſſed with feare, as that they ſhall at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes bee made to ſtoupe: But yet they newe gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But within a while after hée became worſe, then euer hee was, euen ſo fared it with Pilate. Nowe, this is to admoniſhe vs, that wee make not accompt of the feare of GOD, as of a blaſte of winde, but let it bee ſtrongly rooted in our hearts. For how did Pilate feare God, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth it was ſuch a feare as made him only to be more inexcuſable.
<pb facs="tcp:7663:65"/> And here wee may ſée why God awakeneth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences of thoſe that are a ſléepe, and would vtterly caſt of the yoke, which brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them to a more narrow conſideration of themſelues, ſo that they ſhalbe made, ſpite of their téethes, to acknowledge their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and féele their ſinnes, although they woulde walter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues aſléepe in them. And therefore all the doubtes, which all the contemners of God and the wicked haue, are euen ſo many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iournaments or dayes ouer, which God graunteth them, to make them voide of all excuſe of ignorance. But anon after, they let ſlippe the Reine, and runne at randon, without any ſtay: as héere wée ſée Pilate did. At the beginning hée was greatly afearde, but ſoone after hée returned to his olde byas againe. For thus he ſaide to Ieſus, <hi>Knoweſt not thou that I haue power to looſe, and condemne thee?</hi> Let vs héere in the firſt place note, that if he had béene a théefe, yet could not he once remoue his finger, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God had giuen him power. Howe then durſt Pilate warrant himſelfe ſuch an outragious licence, to condemne and pardon as pleaſed him. And ſurely it were much better to ſet at libertie all Théeues, to robbe and ſpoyle in the woods, then to ſet men in ſo honorable a place. who take pleaſure and delight in their authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and neuer haue any care of conſcience, but bring the whole worlde vnto confuſion.</p>
               <p>Nowe, wée ſée héere (as I haue ſaid) that Pilate his feare neuer tooke déepe roote in him, but was onely a puft of winde. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs learne to haue aſure and conſtant feare of God, that we may walk in his obedience, and valiantly fight againſt whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer might put vs by, and alwayes thus reſtraine our ſelues, as that we prouoke not him to wrath, who hath all power ouer vs. And this is it which wée are héere to conſider of. Let vs alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides conſider, that the glory which Pilate attributed to himſelfe, is notwithſtanding turned to his great ſhame. For his enimies coulde neuer ſpeake worſe of him then for this: to wit, that hee woulde be taken to be a man of no diſcretion to diſcerne betwixte good and bad: and yet hée boaſted himſelfe of it. Héere therefore wée ſée, that the higher the diſpiſers of God think to aduance them ſelues, they muſt alwayes feele, that they are the more ſhameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bée throwne downe: and God ſo giueth them ouer into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate ſence, as that they bragge of their iniquities, that they
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7663:65"/> might become deteſtable both in heauen and earth. What is there then for vs to doe? Forſooth, let vs learne to glory in that which is good, and haue an eye to doe the thing that is lawefull. For they which glory in their mightineſſe, and in their authoritie, without doubt doe prouoke the Lorde to anger, becauſe they haue many times gotten their riches and credit by vnlawfull meanes, as by rioting, crueltie, and all kindes of extortion. Wherfore when they glory héerein, it is as it were to ſet them ſelues againſt the Lord. For he that hath gotten euery way by ſpoyle, will ſay I am wealthie: and ſée, he wil ſay, I haue gotten, whenas he hath ſucked the blood of the poore out of them. But howe? Surely, by deceipt and wicked practiſes, in robbing the one, and glutting the other. Another man, through abition, and vnlawful meanes, is aduaunced to ſome honor, and héerevpon forſooth, this man would bée greatly feared. And this kinde of dealing is manyfeſtly to ſtande againſt God, And therefore (as I haue ſaid) let vs learne to glory in that which God alloweth and liketh of. True it is, that although there bée valure in vs, yet is it not lawfull to vſurpe the commendation which God reſerueth to himſelf, and for the which wée ought to honor him, becauſe, all that we haue commeth of his frée gifte. Wherefore, wée muſt not without doubt, glory in our ſelues, as if that which God giueth vs apperteined vnto vs: But, I ſay, our glory ſhoulde be onely in this, that it hath pleaſed God to adopt vs for his children, and hath giuen vs his grace to walke in his feare, and power alſo to abſtaine from euill. And héerin, ought to be all our glory. And beſides, if wée bée of no reputation in the worlde, let vs beſéeche him to graunt vs pacience, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſire to liue in this eſtate, then to bée exalted, and yet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce and bée glad, but not as the worldlinges doe, who, make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſuch ſporte, as that there is nothing that is able to holde them in. And therefore the ſumme and effect wherein wée muſt glory: is this, to wyll and deſire no more then God woulde haue vs to doe, and ſet our ſelues againſt whatſoeuer hée miſliketh of, although the worlde and all ſuch as commit tyranny, and excéede in doeing wickedly, reioyce in it. Wherefore let vs gladly and willingly leaue all theſe glories, deſiring nothing els but to haue God to acknowledge and allow vs for his children. And this is in effect, the thing which wée haue héere to conſider of.</p>

               <p>Nowe, for a full concluſion, it is ſaide, <hi>That when Pilate ſawe he preuailed nothing, and that the people made a greater ſtirre, hee waſhed his handes, and ſaide, I am innocent of the blood of this man.</hi> Wée haue already ſaide, that our Lorde Ieſus muſte bée founde innocent, euen by the Teſtimonie of the iudges owne mouth.

Why then was he condemned?<note place="margin">

For, it is ſaide, that hée is the vnſpotted Lambe of God. And becauſe hee was the Lambe of God, it was méete that hee ſhoulde bée condemned as a Sacrifice. This worde, <hi>Lambe,</hi> importeth that hée muſt bée offered vp. And what is it that the law calleth Sacrifices? Forſooth, it is ſinnes, and curſes. And wée ſée why it is ſaid that our Lord Ieſus was accurſed for vs: to wit, he receiued vnto himſelfe, the curſe which was due for our ſinnes. Thus wée ſée in what qualitie and ſtate hée was condemned: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe GOD had eſtabliſhed, that hée ſhoulde bee as it were the Lambe, which ſhoulde be offered for a Sacrifice. Howbeit it was méete hée ſhoulde bée knowne to be without ſpot, and his puritie be openly ſéene, to the ende wée might take holde of our ſinnes, vntyll the time wée knowe Ieſus Chriſte to bée the myrror of all perfection, and enter into the tryall and examining of our ſinnes, and bée diſpleaſed with them, and condemned, and we ſhould haue béene, had he not deliuered and fréed vs. Nowe, when Pilate had taken the Baſon and waſhed his hands, that was ouer trifling a a Ceremony and a very fooliſh faſhion: as though he coulde haue diſcharged himſelf before God for it: Howbeit, when he attempted to appeaſe the rage of the people, that was not to make his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe vnto God, For, he proteſted not before God, that he was inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent: but ſaid only to the people, looke well to your ſelues my mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: For, as for my ſelfe I am innocent. As if hée ſhoulde haue ſaid, it is you that inforce mée to doe this. But all this (as I haue ſaid) wil not excuſe him. Neither did he the duetie of a Iudge: For he ſhoulde haue choſen rather to die an hundred times, then to haue declined from the doing of his duetie, whenas he ſée ſuch

But when he ſaw the people in this heat, he was contented to be carried as pleaſed them. Notwithſtanding, he muſt, in ſpite of his bearde, be a witneſſe of the innocency of Ieſus Chriſte, euen for the iuſtifiyng of him by his owne mouth. And yet he would néedes condemne him, howbeit therein lyeth al our comfort: for we know that when we are at this day brought to appeare before the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat of God, it is not to the end wee ſhoulde bee condemned. But becauſe the blood of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt which was ſhed for vs, is the true and right clenſing and waſhing of our ſoules, hée receiueth vs as pure and cleane. And thus wée ſee whereunto wée muſt truſt. Yet for all this, we héere what the Iewes ſay: for they are ſo headlong caried, by the ſtrength of Satan, as that they crie out, <hi>His blood be vpon vs and vpon our children.</hi> Now they were Gods inheritance, and the very elect and choſen amongeſt all the nations of the earth, and yet they gaue ouer this honor, and all the promiſes of ſaluation, and this holy aliance which God had eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with their line.

And if it ſo fall out, that wée muſt néeds be made ieſting ſtockes, and bée cut of as rotten mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and bée abhorred and deteſted. Let vs paciently abide al this geare, and not ſée it, vntill ſuch time as that day commeth wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our ſorowes ſhalbée turned into ioy, &amp; God ſhal wype away the teares from our eyes, and that the thing which is nowe thought to bée, as ſhameful, ſhall then bée wholly turned to honour and glory. For without al doubt, looke whatſoeuer wée ſuffer for the name of Ieſus Chriſt, is more honorable before God, then all the pompes and glittering ſhewes of this worlde. And this is it which wée are to conſider of in this place. Nowe the Euangeliſt goeth on and ſaieth, that they which paſſed by, mocked our Lord Ieſus, but eſpecially the Prieſtes, the Scribes, and ſuch like. And what was the matter I beſéeche you? Forſooth thus they ſaide: <hi>If hee bee the Sonne of GOD,</hi> let him come downe and ſaue himſelfe for hée hath ſaued others, and if hée bée the king of Iſrael, let him nowe ſhewe himſelfe ſo. Héere wée ſée howe terrible blinde theſe wretched people were, whom Satan had ſo poſſeſſed as that they had neither féeling nor yet diſcretion. Wée ſée alſo the Prieſtes, who ſhoulde haue béene the Angels or meſſengers of GOD: for hée had appoynted them for that purpoſe,<note place="margin">Malach.</note> to the ende his worde and will, might be knowen from their mouthes. VVee ſée likewiſe the Scribes, who were acquainted with the lawe, and yet by thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to make our Lorde Ieſus no bodie, declared that they troade vnder foote the Holie Scripture, al the Religion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they ſo much bragged. For when the Meſſias was ſpoken of vnto them before,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.5.</note> they coulde ſay that hee muſte bee borne in Bethlehem, and they were aduertiſed and informed alſo that the redéemer whiche was promiſed them, muſte ſuffer ſuch a death.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7663:69"/> And this was no darke thing: The place of Iſaiah alſo was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, if ſo be there had béene a recitall made of that which our Lorde Ieſus indured. They might therefore, knowe that it was impoſſible to haue thoſe thinges better ſet downe in order, then the Prophet had doone, although hee ſpake of it many yéeres before. And beſides, there are many ſayinges both in Zachery, &amp; in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell, that God would gather his people together, and thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore his Churche againe: which is, that the redéemer ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all the ſhame and curſe of the worlde. Why then are they ſo bent againſt the ſonne of God, when hee diſcharged his office, as hath ſufficiently béen declared by the Prophetes? Surely, wee may ſee that Satan carried them away, whenas they had forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten all that they knewe before. And therefore, let vs be wel ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, ſo to walke in the feare of God, as that when we haue had a taſte of his worde, we reuerently receiue him, &amp; obey our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte who is there, offered vnto vs. For in him it is, that wée muſt finde all perfect bleſſedneſſe: if ſo bee we come humbly vnto him. For if we thinke to reſt with God, it is reaſon our foole hardineſſe ſhould be paid the ſame wages, that theſe wretched men of whom héere we reade, were, who were ſo violently carried with fury and rage.</p>
               <p>Now, we are to make our profite by theſe blaſphemies, in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them cleane contrary. For we ſee, that becauſe our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte woulde be our king and head, it coſt him therefore his life, And the enimies of the truth ſaid. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>f he be the king of Iſrael, let him ſaue himſelfe: But this muſt he abide in his owne perſon, for the purchaſing of our ſaluation. Whie then would not our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte ſpare himſelfe? Wherefore ſuffered he ſo bitter and ſlaunderous a death, but becauſe it could not be, that we ſhould bée deliuered but only by ſuch a raunſome. And therefore we ought to bend our ſelues againſt all the ſupporters of Satan, &amp; againſt all ſuch villanies as vomite out ſuch blaſphemies as the Euangeliſt ſpeaketh of: and be moſt aſſured, that we haue in déed a king, who hath more eſtéemed of our ſaluation, then of his owne life, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden whatſoeuer was méet for our rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption, hauing none other reſpect, but to redéeme that which was loſt. For our caſe were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, if the ſonne of God had left vs in our eſtate &amp; conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But when he ſo hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled himſelfe vnto death, by which we are deliuered
<pb facs="tcp:7663:70"/> and abode al this ſo paciently, this is the cauſe why God now ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth foorth his hande &amp; power, to ſuccour vs in our neceſſitie. And therfore it was méete y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God ſhould forſake our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that wée might at this day vnderſtand, that hée is watchfull ouer our ſaluation, and will be redy to helpe our wantes, when we call on him for it. Let vs alſo learne to arme our ſelues againſt ſuch temptations, whenas the Diuell ſhall goe about to aſſaile vs, and woulde make vs beléeue that God hath forſaken vs, and turned his backe vpon vs, thereby to make vs thinke it, a vaine thing, to put our truſt in him. Wherefore, let vs euen then vnderſtand, that Ieſus Chriſte is the true defendor of all the faithfull, and hath ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vs the way what to do: and therfore it is good reaſon that we ſhould follow him in the ſame trace. For, he hath abidden, to haue ſuch blaſpemies to bée powred out againſt him, and yet hath ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly withſtood, as that he hath obteined heereby victory for vs. And therefore let vs valiantly reſiſt whenas the Diuel ſhall come to attempt vs, to turne our faith vpſide downe, and ſhut the gate againſt vs, that wée ſhould not haue acceſſe to God, as though hée had cléerely forgotten vs. But let vs follow our Lord Ieſus Chriſt &amp; waite the good time when god ſtretcheth foorth his arme, to ſhew that he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion vpon vs, and is our father, although hée ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth vs for a while to be ſo beaten downe. And thus we ſée what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ieſtes &amp; ſcofs are which were blyrted out againſt our Lord Ieſus Yet had they moe of them, for thus they ſaid, <hi>He truſted in God, let him deliuer him now, if he loue him.</hi> This ſaying, was alreadie prefigured in the perſon of Dauid:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.9.</note> For theſe very wordes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, when as he complained that his enimies had taken occaſion to ſpeake euill againſt him, and treade him vnder foote, reproching him for the truſt and confidence that he had in God. Now, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that this is the deadlieſt wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that Satan can giue vs: For as the life of man conſiſteth in the ſoule, euen ſo the life of the ſoule conſiſteth in faith, &amp; in the refuge which we haue vnto God, being ſtayed vpon his promiſes. If we be ſpoyled héereof, wée are cleane vndone, &amp; vtterly ſpoiled. And thus we ſée why Satan went about to turne the faith which Ieſus had in God his father vpſide down It is true that Ieſus Chriſte fought with another manner of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are able: for no incredulitie could touch him: But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it was, yet he felt how gréeuous thoſe temptations were. For
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7663:70"/> as the Diuell had before deuiſed ſuch thinges, hée now redoubled them in his ſupporters. For hée had ſaid vnto him, If thou bee the ſonne of God make theſe ſtones to become bread, that thou maieſt eate: becauſe thou art hunger ſtaruen.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ma..</hi> 4.13.</note> And ſéeſt thou not that thou muſt be tryed whether thou haſt any power or no.</p>
               <p>Now in this, Ieſus Chriſte felt no more, then when they héere reproched him for putting his truſt in God. And although we haue not the like power ſo to reſiſt, without falling: yet ought we to be ſtrengthened by him, becauſe wée knowe that hée vanquiſhed and ouercame all theſe temptations for vs, and for our commoditie. And this is alſo another thing which they ſaid, <hi>That hee had ſaued others, and could not ſaue himſelfe.</hi> Héere wée ſée again, that they were giuen ouer into a reprobate ſenſe. For, in that hée ſaued o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, was not this a ſure and an infallible token of his heauenly power? Ieſus Chriſte rayſed the dead, which they knewe well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, hée gaue the blinde their ſight, hée healed the ſicke of the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, reſtored the lame, and caſt out the Diuels themſelues. And thus wée ſée that Ieſus Chriſte powred foorth the great treaſures of his goodneſſe, and power in all his myracles: and yet they repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched him with them for all that. Wée therefore héere ſée that theſe miſerable bewitched people, without conſtraint of any man, are their owne Iudges, to take away all excuſe from themſelues: ſo that when they ſhall appeare before the iudgement ſeat of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, they ſhal neuer bée able to alleadge any thing to ſaue themſelues: for beholde their owne mouthes condemne them. For if our Lorde Ieſus ſaued other, without doubt hée was able to ſaue hymſelfe, but that he preferred others before him ſelfe. What other thing can héere bée ſeene, ſaue onely a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full goodnes, in that he would bée throwne downe as men thought to drawe vs out of the bottomeles depthes: that he woulde ſuffer all that wée deſerued, to the end he might acquite vs thereof: to be ſhort, hée forſooke all temporall welfare: that is to ſay, hée cared not for his life, hée ſpared not his owne perſon, that wee might bee aſſured of our euerlaſting ſaluation, and haue ſuch a pawne and payment for it. So much the more therefore ought our faith to bée ſtrengthened: and when wée ſée, that al whatſoeuer the diuel hath deuiſed to trouble and hinder vs from going to our Lorde Ieſus
<pb facs="tcp:7663:71"/> Chriſt, ought to ſerue for our furtherance, that we might be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of aſſured and profite our ſelues thereby. Now, this is certaine, that the Diuell bendeth all his force to hinder vs in this behalfe. For hée knowing wherein our ſaluation lyeth, hath ſet himſelfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together againſt it, that hée might ſpoyle vs thereof. For hée knoweth, that if hée can bring vs to bée offended at the perſon of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, that wée are all vndoone by it: and wée haue too too much experience thereof.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, all the offences which the Diuell rayſeth againſt vs, and ſetteth before our eyes, to withdrawe vs from the ſonne of God, ſhould be things to confirme vs. For (as alredy hath béene declared) when it is ſaide that Ieſus Chriſte ſaued others, and not himſelfe: it is a ſpeache which in our iudgement ſhoulde cauſe vs to conceiue a diſdaine againſt the perſon of the ſonne of God euen to refuſe him, and not to truſte in him. But let vs cleane contrary vnderſtand, that when the ſonne of God had no regard to himſelfe nor cared for his owne life, it was, becauſe hée eſtéemed the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſoules to bée ſo deare and precious, as that he would beſtow all hée had thereon. And therefore, ſince it is ſo, wée ſhoulde bée ſo fully minded, as to call on him, and be throughly certified, that he ſuffered not on vaine for vs.</p>
               <p>Now, for that they ſaid, <hi>Behold him which deſtroyeth the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and buildeth it again it three dayes,</hi> this was too too villanous a malice to faine that Ieſus Chriſte ſaide, that he woulde deſtroy the Temple.<note place="margin">

Now, hée had none other meaning, but that his enimies ſhould be the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which he ſpake of. And when they had crucified him, might they not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue vnderſtood y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the thing was alreadie begun to be accompliſhed?

Now, they deſtroyed it, as much as lay in them, and hee
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7663:71"/> built it againe in the ende of thrée dayes. Neither had they forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it: for they knewe,<note place="margin">Mat. 27.63.</note> that they had ſoone after tolde as muche to Pylate. But héerein we ſée, that when the Deuill hath taken poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of vs, hee maketh vs ſo blockiſh, as that there is no wit in vs to diſcerne betwéene good and euil: and wée grow ſo ful of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as that wée will clearely caſt God out at the Cartes arſe, as wée ſay, euen as though fully, and of ſet purpoſe we meant to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt him.

For, to the outwarde ſhewe, and according to our reaſon, we ſée nothing els in his death, but ſhame and confuſion: howbeit Ieſus Chriſt amended all in his reſurrection. And therefore, ſince it is ſo, our faith ought to be ſo much the rather confirmed, and wée to ſet our ſelues againſt Satan, and againſt all that hée is able to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine and deuiſe for the ſhaking of our faith, and making of vs to doubt. As concerning that which is ſaide, <hi>That they gaue our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt vineger, mingeled with Gall and Myrrhe, to drinke,</hi> It is to be preſumed that they did it, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome that was in thoſe dayes, to ſhorten the life of malefactors. Howbéeit our Lorde Ieſus, when hée had taſted of it, woulde not drinke it, becauſe hée knew that his houre was not yet come. They had then a cuſtome, that before the malefactors were vpon the top of the Gallowes, to giue them this drinke, that it might trouble the blood, and ſo they ſhould yéeld vp the ghoſt the ſooner. For this kinde of death was verie cruell, and therefore they had néed of theſe helpes. And in déede, wée ſhall hereafter ſée, that the théeues had their bones cruſhed and broken, to the end they might féele no more payne. But howeuer it was, our Lord Ieſus would not drinke this drinke, becauſe hée would ſhew that hée was readie, obedient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to receiue the ſtate and condition, which God his Father had committed vnto him. In déede, this was a verie ſharpe kinde of death: For (as we haue before heard) ouer and beſide the terrible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it, there were in it ſpirituall torments, whereof by Gods leaue we will ſpeake to morrow. All which, were to cauſe our Lord Ieſus to haſten his death as much as was poſſible: but his
<pb facs="tcp:7663:72"/> will was, to ſubmit him ſelfe, moſt obediently to abide what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ſoeuer, vntill hée were deliuered without the helpe of man. And this is it which here we haue to conſider of. But as for the parting of his garments, and the caſting of lots on them, theſe thinges were done,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.19.</note> that the ſcipture might be fulfilled. For Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid being a figure of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt maketh the like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaintes. True it is that this was ſpoken but by way of a ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, when it is ſaide, that vineger and gall were mixt together in his drink,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.22.</note> and that there was a deuiſe made to ſpoile him, and that hée ſhould be more and more greeued in his afflictions: euen as cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell and ſauage people will adde more affliction vnto miſerable ſoules, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue done the worſt they can. And this ſimilitude Dauid vſed, when it is ſaid that hée was made a pray, euen for the ſpoile. For he ſpake it in reſpect of his wife, his houſe, and of all his goods and ſtate of life. Howbeit, it muſt néedes be, that this muſt be openly ſéene in the perſon of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And therefore, vineger &amp; gall was giuen him, that it might be knowne that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid was but a figure of him in déed, &amp; that hée was the true Redée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, promiſed from the beginning. For, why was the kingdom ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunced in the houſe of Dauid, except it had béen promiſed that it ſhould longer continue, then the Sunne and Moone? And therefore it was the euerlaſting kingdome, which was eſtabliſhed in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Redéemer. For it was méete, that theſe thinges which were ſhadowed and figured in the perſon of Dauid, ſhould be made perfect in Ieſus Chriſt, as here we ſée. Moreouer, as for that which the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſt ſpeaketh of, for the théeues that were with our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who mocked him, that is ſet downe as a thing by it ſelfe:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke.</hi> 23.39.</note> as appeareth by S. Luke, who hath declared theſe thinges more at large. Howbeit, this is a common maner of ſpéech: as if a man ſhould ſay, This is ſpoken as if it were to yong children, for if there were but one, yet it would bee taken in the plurall number. It was méete alſo that there ſhould be ſome women amongſt. And yet there was but one. And therfore, after this maner it is ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al men ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues againſt him, &amp; mocked &amp; blaſphemed him, euen the théeues themſelues. For when a man is hanged betwéene two théeues, it is to the end, the more to aggrauate this ſhameful death. In déed, this was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place, where they were wonted to execute ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors. And yet they were not contented that they had put him to this foyle: But it muſt néedes be, that he muſt be eſtéemed to be
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7663:72"/> worſe then the arrandeſt and ſtrongeſt théeues of the world, when as they were both hanged, one each ſide one, to the end it might bée ſaid, that hée was the maiſter théefe amongſt them all. And heerein (as S. Marke ſaith) the ſaying of the Prophet was verified,<note place="margin">Mar. 15.<hi>28.</hi>
                  </note> that he was accounted amongſt the wicked. Now, and if he had not béen thus accounted of, in what caſe ſhould we at this day ſtand before the Lord? For we could not obteine grace without iuſtice. It is méet that God ſhould hate &amp; reiect vs, vntill ſuch time as we were made righteous, and cleanſed of all our ſinnes and offences in his ſight. And that it might be ſo, could God deny himſelfe? Could he be robbed of his holineſſe, righteouſneſſe, &amp; puritie? And therfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we ſhal come before him all filthy and beſmeared, hée muſt néedes abhorre vs. How ſhould we then be iuſtified before God, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt had béen accounted amongſt malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Wherefore we are exempt out of this ranke, &amp; God receiueth vs, and taketh vs as me according vnto his hearts deſire, as if we were altogether cleane &amp; innocent, becauſe our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſuffred ſuch ſhame and ſlander before men. And this is it which in ſumme we are to conſider of touching théeues. But to make a full concluſion, we muſt ſet down the words of S. Luke, which is, that one of the théeues, rebuked his companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when as he ſée him ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate. What ſaith he, it wil be hie time for thée now, or els neuer, to ſtoupe &amp; humble thy ſelf. For behold, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation &amp; puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which thou ſuffreſt for thy miſdéeds &amp; faults: thou art a man plunged ouer head and eares in all curſes: &amp; although thou haſt bin ſo beaſtly, as to delight thy ſelfe all thy life long in thy wickednes, yet ſhouldeſt thou now begin to ſigh and grone. For, the moſt diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute man that is, although he wantonly paſſe his time all his life long and neuer thinketh to come to a reckoning, &amp; ſcorneth iuſtice, and ſetteth himſelf againſt it, becauſe he thinketh he ſhal eſcape vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed, yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is laid hold on, words wil not ſerue his turn. Behold (ſaith he) in what great torments thou art: and thou ſeeſt that both God &amp; men do bring thée to an account: &amp; thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo telleth thée, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is for thy ſins that thou ſuffreſt this: &amp; wilt thou for all this, ſet thy ſelfe againſt God. Thus we ſée, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this ſaying ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie well declareth, that this théefe was taught by the ſpirit of God. And although we ſhal, out of all cry (as we ſay) ſée this verie often: yet may we iudge by this ſaying, what a good ſchoolemaſter y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit
<pb facs="tcp:7663:73"/> of God is, when as he ſo well inſtructeth thoſe who haue erred, and haue become like bruite beaſts: that they haue not onely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged their offences, and ſubmitted them ſelues for the obteining of grace: but alſo haue béen able eftſoones to talke lyke Doctours, and like men which had long time béene acquainted with the holy Scriptures. For, can we make a better and ſounder exhortation to a man that is growne ſo hard hearted, and which neuer ceaſeth to ſtorme againſt God, when as hée ſhould yéeld, and come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce, then ſuch a one, as this wretched théefe hath here made. But how euer it is, this kind of admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did him no good, whom Satan in ſuch ſort had poſſeſſed, but to make him without excuſe. And although it did him no good to whom it was made, yet let it auayle vs at this day. And albeit God ſpareth vs, yet let vs learne to feare him: But chiefly and aboue all, if hée ſcourgeth vs, and will haue vs féele that hée is angrie with vs, Let vs then bée the rather touched to groane, and conſtantly and patiently ſuffer our afflictions, as wée ſée the poore théefe to haue done: and not proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and outragiouſly lift vp our ſelues as the other did.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, we ſée theſe two, to be as it were the mirrours of all mankinde: becauſe we ſée in what miſeries we are wrapped. For this life is euen an hell of all miſeries, euen the verie fruite of our ſinnes, becauſe we were depriued of the bleſſing of God by the fall of Adam. And yet this is true, that God of his ineſtimable good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hath ſurpaſſed this curſe, when as hée continually hath ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed him ſelfe ſundrie wayes: a Father, making vs to féele the gentleneſſe, and loue which hee beareth vs, and the care alſo which hée hath ouer vs. Howbeit we haue many ſignes and tokens of our ſinnes, by which we may perceiue that God curſeth vs both in heauen and in earth: becauſe that death is common to vs all. For when we haue languiſhed in this world, and haue béene ſubiect to many diſeaſes, to heate and colde, and haue béen gréeued and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented diuers manner of wayes: to be ſhort, that we haue ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red infinite miſeries, what will be the end of all? Surely euen this, That we muſt turne into rottenneſſe and duſt. Now, we ſée ſome, whom God ſo toucheth, as that the afflictions which they endure ſerue them for their benefite, and are good helpes vnto them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that ſaying of S. Paule.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.28.</note> And others we ſée to waxe worſe:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7663:73"/> and in ſteade of humblinge them ſelues, and to bee repentaunt, are ſo much the more infected and poyſoned: prouokinge eftſoones the wrath of God, and driuing him into an hoat burning flame, to conſume them therin: and all this we ſée. And therefore let vs looke vpon theſe two théeues, as the mirrors of all the worlde: for from hte hyeſt to the loweſt, wee are all gultye before the Lorde. Yea and yf we all ſuffered this together, what is hee that might bragge of his innocencye: or who is hee that coulde purchaſe his pardon? Wherefore ſéeinge wee are ouer head and eares in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, wee iuſtly ſuffer for our ſinnes: and yet we wyll not all alyke graunt it: becauſe there are ſome (as we haue ſaid) which waxe rather worſe, and there rebellion agaynſt God is openlye ſéene: For they gnaſhe their téeth, ſpewe out their rage and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, and will neuer agrée to this condemnation: or els they take the bit in their mouthes, and ſhewe them ſelues ſo ſtubborne, as that they wyll not ſtick to ſaye, that God ſhall winne nothing by it, nor yet haue the maſterie of them.</p>
               <p>Now, let vs conclude, that when miſerable ſinners acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their ſinnes, and be humbled, and confeſſe the debt, giuinge glory to God, declaring alſo that he handleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> iuſtlye and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is good reaſon they ſhould be ſo chaſtiſed: when I ſay, wretched ſinners be drawne to this reaſon, let vs vnderſtand, that God hath put to his hande, and touched them with his holy ſpirit, that we may ſée his wonderful infynit goodnes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>as he pulleth thoſe out of deſtruction, and hell, whoſe caſe before, was as it were deſperat.</p>
               <p>In ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me, we ſée in the perſon of this miſerable théefe, ſo excellent an example of faith as neuer was ſéene. And therfore we ſhould be ſo much the rather rauiſhed with ſuch a miracle as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God wrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght for in what ſtate ſtoode he? Beholde he was nie his death: hée ſuffered horrible tormentes: he looked to haue his bones to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and broken, and to be diſmembered: whiche was ſo ſharppe and terrible a torment, as that it was euen enough to haue made him haue loſt both ſence and memorye: hee ſawe alſo our Lorde Ieſus who moſt flaunderouſlye was to be hanged there, as well as him ſelfe: and yet ſée what wordes he vſed? for he doth not onely acknowledge his ſinnes for the humblinge him ſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:7663:74"/> God, he doth not onely vſe the office of a teacher to bring home his companyon, and to ſet him in the right way, but maketh ſuche a confeſſion as is more worth then all the reſt, if we conſider well the circumſtances. <hi>I beſeeche thee</hi> (ſaieth hée) <hi>remember mee whenas thou commeſt into thy kingdome.</hi> How was it poſſible that he could conceiue that Ieſus Chriſt had a kingdome? for hee was hanged on trée, and curſed of God and men. For, this ſayinge of the lawe, was ſpoken by the mouth of God: curſed is hee that hangeth on tree.<note place="margin">Deut. 21.23. Galat. 3.13.</note> Neither dyd this come to paſſe by chaunce (as we commonly ſay) that God put his onely ſonne to it. And therefore, when he ſée Ieſus Chriſt to be there accurſed both before God, and men, yea as one throwne downe into a deſperat caſe, as farre as mans reaſon could reach vnto, hee had not ſuch a ſtayed brayne to ſay that Ieſus Chriſt was a Kinge, without hee had ſpoken it in faith and in ſpirit. For, he ſaw ſuch thinges as might haue made him decline from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſon of God, &amp; to haue made him thus conclude, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was but an abuſe &amp; mockery to truſt in him: and yet he called him king, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſée him ready to dye. <hi>I beſeeche thee</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>ſaue mee,</hi> and graunt mée lyfe: For it thou wilt remember mée, that, is all the bleſſedneſſe that I deſyre.</p>
               <p>Now, when wee ſhall well conſider of theſe circumſtances, without all doubte, the faith of this théefe was ſo excellent and great, as that neuer any man that euer lyued, had the lyke. And therefore, let not vs be a ſhamed to be his diſciples: for, to ſay the trueth, the death of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt wyll neuer ſtande vs in any ſtead except we condemne our ſelues, that we might be ſaued through him: neither will God euer pardon vs, without wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe our ſelues to be moſt wicked &amp; filthy. Since then it is ſo that we are guiltie before God, and that our owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſciences doo iudge and condemne vs, let vs not be a ſhamed to folow this théefe his ſteps, ſéeing he may be a good Scholemaſter vnto vs. And becauſe our Lord Ieſus is aſcended now into heauen, and hath taken poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the glory which God his father hath giuen him,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.10.</note> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end euery knée might bow vnto him, let vs not doubt to put our ſelues wholy into his cuſtody, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude &amp; ſay, loe wherin lieth our felicity to wit y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ieſus Chriſt is mindful of vs, &amp; gouerneth vs: &amp; becauſe he was ordayned to be our ſhepheard, he wil be watchful ouer our ſaluation, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we might be ſafe &amp; ſure vnder his hand and protection.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:7663:74"/>
               <p>Moreouer, let vs learne, paciently to beare the miſeries of this preſent life, ſo that it maketh not vs decline from comming vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. For we ſée here, that the théefe was heard: and yet was hee faine to abide and harde and terrible death. Let vs therefore ſo eſtéeme of the ſpirituall grace which is giuen vs by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and which is dayly offred vnto vs by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell, as that it may make vs ouercome all the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes, griefes, domages, troubles and temptations, which any way may come vnto vs, ſo that all our afflictions might be miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated: becauſe we know that they ſhal all turne to our benefit and welfare, through the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And this is it which we are here to obſerue. And beſides, let vs here to ioyne the the anſwere of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, when he promiſed that hée ſhould be that day with him in Paradiſe. For, although our Lord Ieſus was not as yet riſen from death, nor had not accompliſhed all that was requiſit for our redemption, and ſaluation, yet had hée alreadie powred abroad the power &amp; fruit of his death and paſſion. True it is, that the fulfilling of all, reſted in the reſurrection: But ſince it is conioyned with his death and paſſion, and that we know he ſuffred in the weakneſſe of his fleſh, euen ſo is he riſen again by the vertue of his ſpirit: and as he ſuffred for our ſinnes, that wée might be made frée before God: ſo likewiſe roſe he againe for our iuſtification: Nowe, when we knowe all this, I ſay, let vs with ſo much the more bold courage, come frankly vnto him: &amp; not doubt, but that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he pleaſeth to remember vs, and hide vs vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of his winges, that we may be able to ſtande againſt Satan, death, and al miſeries, &amp; glory in our weakneſſe. And although we be in the ſight of the world, but miſerable wretched ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Let vs now fall downe before the maieſtie of our good God, and acknowledge our offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, beſéeching him to make vs more &amp; more, to féele the gréeuouſnes of them, &amp; to be ſo touched with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as that our repentance might continually, be mightiller co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed, that we might grone for them and ſo walk in the feare of our God, as that, he might be glorified by vs: to the end we might ſhew wherfore hée hath redéemed vs, and learne to conſecrate our ſelues in all puritie

Nowe, if any man alledge &amp; ſay, that the ſtate of the miſerable théefe is not to be compared with the chiefe Gouernours of the Church, being the Prieſtly trybe whom God had choſen, for the teaching of the lawe: it is out of all doubt, that when we ſpeake of the ſaluation which God of his fré mercy purchaſed for vs, we muſt not looke for any worthineſſe that is to be founde in vs: But rather agrée to that ſaying of Saint Paule.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim. 1.</hi>13.</note> That this is a true doctrine, that Ieſus Chriſt came into the world to ſaue ſinners. And therefore, when wée conſider of the death and paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, it is méete that all men ſhould yéeld, and confeſſe them ſelues to be moſt miſerable and ſhameful, to the end God might poure vpon them by that meanes the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of his mercy, without any other regard to helpe vs, ſaue that he ſeeth vs, moſt miſerably to be plunged ouer head and eares. And becauſe that this théefe was a moſt abiect man, and that God had ſo ſodeinly called him yet ſéeing the death and paſſion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, which hée ſuffred for all mankinde, was auaileable vnto him, the ſame ſhould a great deale the rather confirme vs.
<pb facs="tcp:7663:76"/> Wherefore, it is out of all queſtion, that God, here thruſteth out his hand as it were, to all thoſe who thinke them ſelues worthie thereof, and deſerue it, or at the leaſt to ſuch as the common people thought the moſt excellent. But when hée pulleth damned ſoules out of the pyt of hell, and when hée ſheweth himſelfe merciful vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe who were vtterly voide of all hope of life, herein ſhyneth his wonderful goodnes. And this is it which giueth vs an entrance into ſaluation: for although hypocrites confeſſe that they are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beholden vnto God for his grace and fauour, yet ſhut they the gate vpon them ſelues, by reaſon of their arrogancy: for their pride is ſuch, as that they cannot ſubmit them ſelues vnto our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. And therfore, let vs in the firſt place be fully reſolued, that Ieſus Chriſt calleth vnto him miſerable ſinners, which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of themſelues, &amp; ſtretcheth out his armes to receiue them. For, if this be not in vs, we ſhal neuer haue the heart to come vnto him. But when we ſhal be throughly perſuaded, that hée purchaſed ſaluation for thoſe who would acknowledge and ſubmit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, to be moſt miſerable and wretched ſinners, and be vtterly aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe their giltines, (as in déed they ought) before y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeate of God: let vs be well aſſured that we ſhal ſoone attain to be partakers of the righteouſnes which is héere offred vs, which is, the obteining of fauour and grace at the handes of God. Now, héere vpon followeth, <hi>That from the ſixt houre vnto the nineth, there was darkneſſe ouer all the lande:</hi> Hée ſpeaketh thus cleane contrary to our common maner of ſpéech, for wee woulde ſay from ſix houres to nine houres. But the Euangeliſt hath followed the ordinary maner of ſpéech that was then vſed. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſpeaketh of the third houre, hée meaneth not at thrée of the clocke: but the fore part of the day. And here in ſumme, are two things to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of. The one is, that they counted the houres otherwiſe then we doe at this day: for they reckoned, the day to beginne from the Sunne riſing, vnto the going downe, which was twelue houres, where we take the day to be foure and twentie houres, accounting from midnight, vntill midnight folowing. And therfore the clocks were to be ſet in ſuch ſort, as that the houres in Sommer ſhoulde not be longer then they were in Winter, and as the dayes were longer or ſhorter, euen ſo were the houres longer or ſhorter. The other point is this, They deuided the day into foure partes, &amp; quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7663:76"/> it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thrée houres, to thrée houres, calling euery quarter by the beginning of the firſt houre. Inſomuch, that, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time which was from the Sunne riſing, vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecond part of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> day, they called the firſt houre. The ſecond part, which was from that time vnto myd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, they called the third houre. The third houre, beganne after midnight, &amp; laſted thrée or foure houres after. And the fourth &amp; laſt part, continued from the Sunne ſetting vntill night. And ſée, why one of the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſts ſaith, that Ieſus Chriſt was crucified about the third houre: where it is here ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was about the ſixt houre.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 15.25.</note> Now, our Euangeliſt ſaith, that there was darkneſſe from the ſixt hour vnto the ninth. For our lord Ieſus was crucified betwixt the third &amp; ſixt houre: and was condemned by Pylate about the third houre. And S. Marke his meaning is, that it was in the ende of the third houre, &amp; not at the beginning of it, when as hée deſcribeth the time that our Lord Ieſus was led vnto Golgotha. Now, hée was vpon the Croſſe vntill the ninth houre, euen then when as it drew all to an ende. And ſo it is moſt like to be true, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our Lorde Ieſus hung not on the Croſſe aboue thrée houres. During which time, it is ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there was darkneſſe ouer the face of all the whole land of Iudea. For it was not a generall Eclipſe ouer the whole worlde. For, if it had bin ſo in déede, it would haue blemiſhed the myracle which God ment to ſhew: for then the Eclipſe would haue bin ſaid to come by the order of nature. And on the other ſide, few me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wold haue ſaid, that it had béene in other countries: and they alſo which make mention therof, might iuſtly be ſuſpected. But behold, it was the onely countrey of Iudea that was couered with darkneſſe. And what time? forſooth euen about thrée houres after noone, when as the Sunne was nothing néere the ſetting: But it behooued that it ſhould then be ſo darke, contrary to all common order, becauſe it might bring a terror and feare vpon all the land. Now, ſome think that this was done in token that God abhorred the déede, as if hée meant to cyte the Iewes, to the ende they might haue ſome féeling of this their horrible cryme which they had committed: and as if hée would ſignifie vnto them by this viſible ſigne, that all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the world ought to be aſhamed of ſo deteſtable an act, as the putting of our lord Ieſus Chriſt in ſuch ſort to death.</p>
               <p>But wée haue to note, that in reſpecte of the Iewes, the death of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte ought to bée taken
<pb facs="tcp:7663:77"/> as it were for a moſt terrible offence, and ſurely God greatly dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted their villainous iniquitie: becauſe it ſurpaſſed all the reſt. And to ſay the trueth, if murther and ſuch like things are to be hated, what ſhall we ſay to the moſt wicked handeling of the Sonne of God? As to ſée men to be ſo bewitched, euen to make no account of him who was the very fountain of life: and ſo to lift vp themſelues as to abuſe the memorie of him, by whom we were created, and by whoſe power we liue and haue our being. And yet the death of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt is become a ſwéete ſmelling ſacrifice: for wée muſt haue continuall recourſe to this,<note place="margin">Ephe. 5.2.</note> that it was the reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the worlde, as heretofore we haue ſaide. Moreouer, darkneſſe was ouerſpread, that the Sonne might bee a witneſſe of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and heauenly Maieſtie of our Lord Ieſus. And therefore, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were for a ſhort time abaſed and contemtible: yea (and as S. Paule ſaith) made of no eſtimation amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt men: yet did the Sonne ſhewe his reuerence to him: and in token thereof hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.<note place="margin">Phil. 2.<hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> Since then it is ſo, Let vs vnderſtande that God, becauſe hée woulde make the wicked to bee ſo muche the more inexcuſable, meant that Ieſus Chriſt ſhould ſhew him ſelfe in his death to bée the ſoueraigne King ouer all creatures: &amp; that the tryumph wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Saint Paule ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.15.</note> beganne alreadie, where it is ſaide that Ieſus Chriſt tryumphed vpon the Croſſe. It is true, that hée appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it vnto that, that hée had cancelled the Obligation which was againſt vs, and whereof hée diſcharged vs before God, by which meane Satan was ouercome: yet notwithſtanding this was declared by the Eclipſe of the Sunne.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, this conuinced the Iewes of ignoraunce, yea, of a malitious and phrantike ignorance, euen as if a man had ſéene before his eyes that Satan had poſſeſſed them, and were become lyke monſters againſt nature. And héere wée are in ſumme to vnderſtande what to conſider of, when it is ſaide, that darkneſſe was ſpread ouer the face of the earth. In verie déede, we are made cleare and bright at this day, by the death and paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. For how cometh it to paſſe, that the Goſpell ſheweth vs the way to ſaluation? And howe are we enlightened to come vnto God, were it not that the Sonne of God with the fruite
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:7663:77"/> and power of his death were offred vs in it. And therefore Ieſus Chriſt is in verie déed the Sonne of righteouſneſſe, becauſe he hath purchaſed vs lyfe, by his death: howbeit the Iewes are depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of this benefite. And in that the Sunne became darke, they were conuinced as men altogether reprobate, ſo that no teaching coulde ſerue their turnes to bée profitable for their ſaluation, ſince by their wickedneſſe they went about to quenche and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe whatſoeuer might put them in any hope: For that hope was onely in the Mediator, whom, they through their wickedneſſe, and vnthankfulneſſe, tooke in hande to make of no eſtimation. Wherefore, it was good reaſon that they ſhould be vtterly voyde of all ſoundneſſe of ſaluation, to the ende the wrath of God might ſhewe it ſelfe in a viſible manner vpon them. It followeth, that our Lorde Ieſus cryed out, ſaying,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 22.1.</note> Saint Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, and Saint Marke, recyte the wordes of our Lorde Ieſus in the Syrian tongue, which is taken out of the Pſalme. 22. Nowe the Euangeliſtes doe not ſo fully and wholly recite the wordes, as they are ſet downe in the text of the Pſalme: namely in this word, <hi>Eli,</hi> which is to ſay, My God, we ſée that Saint Marke ſaieth, <hi>Eloe,</hi> But that was by reaſon of the corruption of the tongue, as heretofore wée haue noted: For, the Iewes, when they returned from Babylon, had neuer ſo pure and ſounde a tongue, as they had before. Howbeit this complaint and crye is taken out of the twentieth and two Pſalme, the firſt verſe. And therefore GOD would namely haue this to bée recyted in two languages, thereby to declare that it was a matter of great weight, which we ought verie diligently to marke. And to ſay the trueth, except we would imagine (as many fantaſticall people doe) that Ieſus Chriſt ſpake after the iudgement of men, and not after his owne féeling and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, it would make vs all to wonder, that Ieſus Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playned, that God his Father had forſaken him. For it were too too blockiſh and fooliſh a thing, to ſay that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt was not ſore tormented and vexed in heart: but that hée ſimplie ſaide, They thinke that I am forſaken. Nowe, this declareth, that they which ſéeke after ſuche gloſes, are not onely ignorant, but alſo verie blockheades and doltes: and ceaſe not beſides, to barke and blaſpheme, lyke Maſtife Curres, againſt the Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie
<pb facs="tcp:7663:78"/> of God. And as many as thus ſay, without doubt, there is no more religion in them, then in dogges and bruit beaſtes, for they know not how dearely the ſonne of God paide for their ſaluation. And that which is worſe, they mocke them ſelues like villaines as they are. Therfore we muſt abſolutely conclude, that when our Lord Ieſus was brought to this extremitie, and torment, he cryed out with a loude voice (yea like vnto thoſe which are in moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible panges) My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mée? And in déed, we haue before ſaid, that we had but a cold pull (as we ſay) by the ſtorie of his death, if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered not of the obedience which he yéelded vnto God his Father. Thus we ſée what the principall point is, that we ſhould looke vnto, when as we would be aſſured of our ſaluation: which is that if we haue committed many offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, rebellions, and iniquities againſt God, that all ſhal be buried, becauſe our Lord Ieſus hath by his obedience iuſtified vs, &amp; made vs acceptable with God his Father. Now, wherin conſiſteth this obedience, but that Chriſt Ieſus, although he ſuffred a cruel &amp; ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible death, yet was contented to yéeld himſelf vnto it. For if he had felt no hardneſſe nor ſtriuing in it, his obedience had béen nothing: But inaſmuch as our Lorde Ieſus abhorred death by nature, yea, and that it was a fearefull thing to appeare before the iudgement ſeate of God in the behalf of all wretched ſinners (for he ſtood foorth there to beare all our burthens) and yet for all that was contented to humble himſelfe to be thus condemned for vs, Let vs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his perfect obedience: and therein we haue verie good matter to glorie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 5.7.<hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> as the Apoſtle in the Epiſtle to the Hebrews ſaith, That the feare of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt was heard: But howeuer it was, it was méet that hée ſhould ſuffer and abide ſo hard &amp; weighty a cauſe, yea cleane againſt all worldly affection and deſire. And therefore, it behooued that God his Father ſhould ſo acquaint him with it, to the ende (as hée ſaith) his obedience might be knowne. Wée ſée then that the Apoſtle namely ſpecifieth, that it muſt néedes bée that our Lorde Ieſus ſhoulde bée wonderfully afeard: for els wée ſhoulde neuer haue knowne what this ſacrifice had béene worth,<note place="margin">Act. 2.24.</note> by which wée are reconcyled. And S. Peter alſo ſheweth that our lord Ieſus Chriſt ſuffred both in body and ſoule, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he ſaith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſtraue a gainſt the ſorrowes of death. In very déed the ſcripture oftentimes telleth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are redéemed by the blood
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:7663:78"/> of Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe he offered vp his bodie for a Sacrifice: &amp; wée alſo ſée why it is ſaid, that his fleſh is ſpiritual meate &amp; drinke:<note place="margin">Iohn. 6.55.</note> but it is ſo ſpoken by reaſon of our groſeneſſe. And becauſe wée are canally minded, the holy Ghoſt ſendeth vs backe vnto that that is viſibly to be perceiued in the death of Ieſus Chriſt, that by it wee might haue an aſſured pawne of our ſaluation. And yet this taketh not away the thing that is ſhewed vs out of other places: neyther doeth it derogate from this poynt, that the death and paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt had ſerued to no purpoſe for the blotting out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iniquities of the world, without he had obeyed, yea euen to the ſubmitting of himſelfe vnto ſo terrible a death, neither obeyed hée (as I haue before ſaid) like one that was without féeling &amp; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding: For although he was to abide maruellous terrible feares and extremities, yet for al that, he preferred our ſaluation before al other reſpects whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Thus wee ſée what it is, that wee are to obſerue in this place, to witte, that the Sonne of GOD hath not onely ſuffered in body ſo cruel &amp; tormentrous a death (as already hath byn ſéene) but was alſo touched to the quicke, whenas he was to abide ſuche horrible aſſaultes, as if God had forſaken him. For, to ſay y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, as he tooke vpon him our cauſes (as hath béene ſaide) it muſt alſo néedes be, that hee muſt féele the condemnation which was due for wretched ſinners. For, by our ſinnes, we are as people eſtranged from God, and therfore he muſt néedes leaue vs, that we might vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that he taketh vs for caſtawayes. Here then we ſée what the eſtate &amp; condition of ſinners is: And this is out of all doubte, that GOD the Father neuer forſooke Ieſus Chriſte: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it muſt néedes bée, that hée ſhoulde ſuffer thoſe paynes, and that hée ſhoulde valiauntly reſiſt them, to the ende, the benefite of the victory might at this day redounde to vs.</p>
               <p>Wée haue therefore to vnderſtande that when our Lorde Ieſus was driuen to this extremitie, as if GOD his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hadde cutte all hope of lyfe cleane from him, it was (as wée haue ſayde) becauſe hée ſuffered the curſe of our ſinnes in his owne bodie, whiche were the cauſe that ſeparated vs from the Maieſty of God. For wherein haue wée any felicity except we bée quickened by the grace of GOD, and enlightened with
<pb facs="tcp:7663:79"/> his brightneſſe? For hée is the verie fountaine of all life and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe, &amp; our ſinnes make a great ſeparation betwéene him and vs. And therefore it was méete that Chriſt Ieſus ſhould féele this. Nowe, let vs come to that that may be ſaide. Is it poſſible that Ieſus Chriſt ſhould be ſo fearefully troubled, ſéeing hée was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection it ſelfe? For this ſéemeth to derogate from the Faith which he ought to haue had, and whatſoeuer we ought to beléeue of him: which is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was without ſpot of ſin. Now, this matter is ſoone anſwered. For when Satan tempted him, it muſt néedes fall out that hée ſhould be ſo taken, as to be ſet vpon the toppe of a pynacle, and according to mans nature,<note place="margin">Mat. 4.5.</note> be ſubiect to ſuch an illuſion: and yet this no whit empaired his diuine power. But we haue rather oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to magnifie his mercy and goodneſſe to vs warde, forſomuch as he ſo abaſed himſelfe to ſaue vs. It is eftſoones ſaid that he cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me.</hi> In the firſt place it is moſt certaine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ieſus Chriſt, inaſmuch as he was God, could haue no ſuch conceit. No: But vntill ſuch time as it fell out, that his Godhead muſt giue place to the death which hee muſt ſuffer. And thus we ſée that the power of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt lay as it were hid for a time, vntill hée had made an end of whatſoeuer was requiſite for our redemption. But nowe, in as much as hée was man, Let vs note that this complaint, féeling, and feare, whereof we nowe ſpeake, hath no manner of way derogated from the faith of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. For, in that hée was man, hée truſted altogether in God, as we haue alreadie heard, and as was yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day ſufficiently handled. This then was the verie true patterne of a right, perfect, and ſounde fayth. Now, it is here ſaid, that he was ſo ſore tormented, as that it ſéemed that God his Father had forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him: and yet had hée alwayes a perfect fayth, without béeing ouerthrowne or ſhaken any kinde of way. Why then ſaieth hée, <hi>Wherefore haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi> This procéedeth from a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall mans conceit. Thus we ſée that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching weake fleſh, is as a man forſaken of God, &amp; yet he giueth not ouer his truſt that hée had in him. Now in déed we ſée two pointes in theſe words, which at the firſt ſight ſéeme cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie one to the other, &amp; yet they agrée very wel together. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith, <hi>My God, my God,</hi> with ſuch a redoubling, he ſheweth therin the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of his faith. He ſaith not, wher is God, what? hath he forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:7663:79"/> me? But hée co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually ſticketh faſt vnto him. And therfore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bée but that he was perſwaded &amp; fully reſolued, that hée ſhould haue fauourable acceſſe alwaies vnto God his father. Héereby (I ſay) wée ſée a certaine and vndoubted teſtimonie of the faith of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, whenas in the middeſt of all his extremities and torments he ceaſſed not to call vpon God his father, without hypocriſie: becauſe he was aſſured that he woulde be merciful vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him ſo long as he called on him. And thus wée ſée, I ſay, a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient declaration of the faith of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte: and yet for all that hée redoubleth it, becauſe it was an harde and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous combate: as if he meant to ſet himſelfe againſt all the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations wherewith Satan coulde any way aſſaile him, and ſought to ſtrengthen his faith, to the ende hée might continually perſeuere in calling vpon God.</p>
               <p>Nowe hée eftſoones ſaith, <hi>Why haſt thou forſaken mee:</hi> and this hée ſpake according to mans reach. For it coulde not be choſen but that hée muſt grow to that point (as wée haue ſaid) and yet not be ouercome thereof, according to that ſaying of Saint Peter,<note place="margin">Acts. <hi>2.</hi>24.</note> that it was impoſſible for him to bée kept vnder with the ſorrowes of death, that is to ſay, that death had taken holde of him, as of a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, wretched, and oppreſſed man. But yet it was impoſſible for him, as ſaieth Saint Peter, to bée holden downe. And ſo he wanne the victorie euen in the middeſt of the fight: and this is ſo much the greater glory vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. Dauid had partly a féeling héereof: for this is moſt ſure that in the middeſt of all his greateſt afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, hée perſeuered in calling vpon God, and truſted in him: But becauſe hée was a weake and fraile man, his faith was oftentimes ſhaken, as he confeſſeth himſelfe. Howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it there was a ſpeciall matter to bée conſidered of, in our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus (whereof wée ſpake on Sunday laſt) and that was this, that al his ſufferinges were rightly ſquared and ordered, by reaſon of his integritie and pureneſſe, in whom was no corruption of nature: But it oftentimes commeth to paſſe that our ſorrowes, yea our feares, and cares proceede from a iuſt cauſe: and yet they ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be intermedled with ſinne, becauſe all our paſſions are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt. But there was no vnquietneſſe nor yet diſorder in our Lord Ieſus. Whereupon it followeth, that his torments were not ſuch but that he had alwaies a ſure and an vndoubted truſt in God, and
<pb facs="tcp:7663:80"/> ſo, firmly and conſtantly called vpon him, becauſe hee right well knew that he would ſaue him euen in the greateſt extremitie. And thervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is ſaid, <hi>That ſome of thoſe which were about him, moc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked him.</hi> This man, ſay they, calleth vpon Elias, let vs ſée and if Elias wil come &amp; help him. It is to bee thought y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Souldiers, who knew not the law, might haue ſaide ſo, wel enough: and yet it had bene but a fooliſh kinde of ſpeach, for they knewe not what the meaning of Elie was. And it is not like that the Prieſtes who were acquanited with the lawe, woulde ſpeake this blaſphemye. What? were they deceiued in the ſaying of our Lorde Ieſus? no: for the Prophet Elias was not named after that ſort. The name therefore was not abuſed: becauſe there coulde be no doubt in it, ſéeing the word of Elias is otherwiſe pronounced: &amp; the word E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that is to ſaye, my God, was as common as was poſſible, and to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe could not rayſe any doubt. And therfore they dyd this of a malicious impudencye vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, when hee ſaide Elie. And if this ſéeme ſtraunge to vs, I beſéeche the Lorde, there be not the lyke examples among vs at this day. For we ſhall ſée the Papiſtes euen at this day ſlaunderouſlye backbite and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praue whatſoeuer we teach, to wit, whatſoeuer is taken out of the pure worde of God, and doo wittinglye and in good earneſt blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme, to make our doctrine hatefull with poore and ſimple ſoules, and ſuch indéede as neuer heard vs once preach. Yea they falſelye depraue whatſoeuer wee ſay, and turne it which way they pleaſe (as may eaſely be ſéene) to coulour their leaſings with and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayne the myſerable blynde and ignoraunt ſoules with their fond and fantaſticall lyes. We ſée héere, how the enemies of God, whom Satan poſſeſſed, had of a malicious purpoſe taken excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the words of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: &amp; euen ſo at this day (as I began to ſay) fareth it with the papiſts. And this is not onely ſéene in poperie, but there are alſo amongſt vs certaine beggers, which will not ſtick to ſaye, that we goe about to make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue that Ieſus Chriſt was in a deſperate caſe and paſt all hope whenas we ſay that he ſuffered the torments of death, and that he was caſt downe, as it were into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bottom of hell, for ſo much as he preſented himſelfe there in our behalfe, and beare the burthen of our ſinnes: howbeit al this is no whit derogatorye from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and vnchaungable faith.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:7663:80"/>
               <p>And héere theſe dogges profeſſors of the Goſpell, neuer ceaſe blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming, wherein they ſhewe themſelues to bée farre worſe, then thoſe, which are in this place ſpoken of. Since then wée ſée, that the Diuell hath at this day whetted the tongues of his Supporters, and that euery of them with a beaſtly ſhameleſſeneſſe vometeth out his poyſon againſt the puritie of doctrine, let not vs thinke it ſtrange, ſéeing our Lorde Ieſus was thus ſlaundered, but pacient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beare theſe blaſphemies, and beſéech the Lorde (as it is ſaide by the Pſalmiſt,) To cut out their villanous tongues,<note place="margin">Pſalm. 12.4.</note> which are ſo full of vyllanie and curſing, tending to none other ende but to the blaſpheming of his name, and darkening of his trueth. Nowe, héereupon the Euangeliſt telleth, <hi>That there was a veſſel ful of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger</hi> (yea, as before hath béene ſaide mingled with Gall) and that one tooke a Réed, or (as Saint Iohn ſaith) a long Iſop braunch, and tyed a ſpunge at the ende therof, to put it to the mouth of our Lord Ieſus. Now Saint Iohn ſpeaketh of this matter more diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, For hée ſaith, <hi>That Ieſus Chriſte</hi> knowing that all thinges were ended, ſaide that hée was dry, and thereupon ſaide againe, <hi>It is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</hi> Wée ſée then what is héere for vs to note, when this drinke was giuen to the ſonne of God: to wit, that hée deſired not to drinke becauſe hée was drye: for hée refuſed it as wée haue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore ſéene, And why did hée ſo? Becauſe forſooth, this drink was giuen him to ſhorten his life. Nowe our Lorde Ieſus meaning was, altogether paciently and quietly to waite vpon the leaſure of God his Father. Thus we ſée what the cauſe was why he would not haſten his death, but helde himſelfe quiet and obedient vntyll ſuch time as all was finiſhed, although hee had not as yet yéelded vp the Ghoſt, nor was riſen againe: for the meaning was that he had ſhewed his full obedience hytherto, ſo that there was no let why he might not nowe render vp his ſoule vnto God his Father. Héere wée then ſee howe this place is to bée vnderſtood: which is this, that our Lorde Ieſus declared that there wanted nothing to the finiſhing of our redemption, ſauing his departure out of the worlde which hee was very ready to doe, and to yéelde his ſoule vnto God. Wherefore, when hee ſawe that he had diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the office of the Mediatour, and had doone whatſoeuer was requiſite for the appeaſing of the wrath of GOD for our ſakes, and ſatiſfied for our ſinnes, he determined to call for this drinke.
<pb facs="tcp:7663:81"/> And héere, is a moſt notable and excellent ſaying, All is finiſhed. For this is certaine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our Lord Ieſus ſpake not of any trifling or ordinary thing: but hée meant, that in his death, we haue all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer that is to bée had for our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming vnto God, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obteining of his grace. Not that his reſurrection is héereby taken away, but it is as much as if he had ſaid, that he had faithfully done his dutie, and came not like an halfe Sauiour, but perfourmed the charge committed vnto him euen to the vttermoſt, leauing nothing of his fathers wil vnfulfilled. And ſince it is ſo, we are taught, to put our truſt fully and wholy in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, becauſe wee knowe that euery part and percell of our ſaluation is finiſhed in that which hée hath done and ſuffered for vs. And héere wée ſée alſo why his death is called an euerlaſting Sacrifice, by which the faithfull and choſen children of God are ſanctified? Will wée then be throughly aſſured that God is our father? Would wée haue frée libertie to call vpon him? Woulde wée haue peaceable and quiet conſciences? Woulde wée bée fully aſſured that wée are reputed for righteous, that wée might be acceptable vnto God. Let vs then abide in Chriſte Ieſus, and wander neither to nor fro, and knowe that in him lieth all perfection. They therfore which ſéeke after o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helpes, &amp; would be ſupplied this way, &amp;, that as if there might bée ſomething wanting in the death and paſſion of our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, doe cléerely forſake the power, whereof wée now ſpeak. To bée ſhort, they trample the blood of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foote: becauſe they diſhonor him. And therefore what other thing is there in all Popery, but an vtter deniall of the death and paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte? For inaſmuche as they thinke to doe good workes, which they call merites, by which they thinke to purchaſe the fauour of God, ſurely, they deny the ſaying of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, <hi>All is finiſhed.</hi> And this prooueth it to bée ſo, for when they thinke to bée ſaued before God, and would bee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned of their ſinnes, whether runne they but vnto their fooliſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions? For euery man will frame vnto himſelfe, ſome maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king mawmetrie at his pleaſure, ſo that all the religions of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is ſo many blaſphemies, to make this ſaying of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte of none effect, All is finiſhed, What ſhall wée then doe? Let vs vnderſtande that there is not a droppe of vertue nor me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite in vs, without wée come vnto this fountaine, wherein is all
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7663:81"/> fulneſſe. And thus we ſée that our faith muſt be ſetled in our Lord Ieſus Chriſte.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, let vs chiefely vnderſtand, that when hée offered himſelfe for a Sacrifice, that it was for the pardoning of vs for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and as the Scripture ſaith, to ſanctifie vs perpetually. And therefore let vs looke for none other ſacrifice but him. In very déed this abhominable diueliſhe Maſſe, is called in Popery, a dayly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: &amp; they ſay,<note place="margin">Pſal. <hi>110.</hi>4. Heb. 7.<hi>21.</hi>
                  </note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ieſus Chriſt was once for al offered for a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obteining of the forgiuenes of our ſins, yet neuertheles that hée muſt bé dayly offered vp: which is manifeſt blaſphemie, becauſe they falſly take vpon them the office which was appointed to our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, whenas hée was ordeined to bée the onely euerlaſting Prieſt, yea, and God bound it with an othe, that his Prieſthood ſhoulde laſt for euer. And therefore, when mortal men will thruſt in themſelues to come before God, &amp; offer vp Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte, doe they not robbe him of the honor which hée reſerued vnto himſelfe alone, and which may not bée giuen to any other creature? Since then it is ſo, wée ſée that theſe miſerable blinde ſoules, thinking to make peace with God, prouoke his wrath and vengeance, denying the death &amp; paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, And therefore ought wée, ſo much the more magnifie the grace of God, for that hée hath drawne vs out of ſuch a bottomeleſſe depth, that when we thought to haue come néere him, wée ſet our ſelues openly againſt him: For wee rob him of the benefite of his death and paſſion, when wée ſeeke after any other Sacrifice then that which he offered in his owne perſon. Nowe it is ſaide, <hi>That he cryed againe with a loude voice, and yeelded vp the Ghoſte:</hi> and this was it, <hi>Into thy hands I commit my ſoule or my ſpirite.</hi> And héerein wee ſee that our Lord Ieſus ſo fought againſt the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes of death, as that he became afterwarde a Conquerer, and tryumphed, becauſe he had ouercome the hardeſt matter of al. And this is the thing which belongeth to vs, to wit, we muſt apply it vnto our owne vſe. For wee are aſſured that the ſonne of God did not onely fight for vs, but alſo that the victory which hee obteined for vs apperteineth vnto vs, and that we ſhoulde not at this day be afeard of death, becauſe wée knowe that the curſe of God which was ſo terrible, is aboliſhed, and that death in ſtéede that it might haue deadly wounded vs, ſerueth vs now for a medicine, to yéelde
<pb facs="tcp:7663:82"/> vs life. Nowe, as hée had before ſaide, after the example of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mée? Euen ſo likewiſe taketh hée at this preſent, the prayer which Dauid made in the one and thirtie Pſalme, Into thy handes I commend my ſpirite. In very déede, Dauid ſaide theſe wordes when he was in the middeſt of all his dangers:<note place="margin">Pſal. 31.6.</note> as if hée ſhoulde haue ſaide, O Lorde, I beſéeche thée receiue mée into thy protection: for my ſoule is as it were in my hands &amp; is there euen at randon: for I ſée how I am thruſt out to all hazardes, and my life hangeth as by a thréed: and therefore thou muſt protect mée. Wée ſée héere then, that Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid by this prayer, made God his protector: and yet gaue hée not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, but ſtill called on him whenas he was at the point of death, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes aſſuring himſelfe that God woulde ſaue his choſen, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in defending the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> héere in this worlde, but alſo when hée calleth them vnto himſelfe. For the chiefeſt regarde that God hath on vs, is this, that when hée hath taken vs out of this worlde, hee hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs vnder his winges that we might inioy his preſence,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>2. Cor.</hi> 5.8.</note> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſaying of Saint Paule to the Corinthes. For when our Lorde Ieſus made this prayer, hée ſheweth that he died quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whenas he ouercame all the combates which hee ſuſteined for vs, and triumpheth in our behalfes, both for our profite, and for our ſaluation. And a none after, he declareth by the ſame meanes that God is his Sauiour, &amp; kéepeth his ſoule as a ſufficient pledge For this much his requeſt imported, when he ſaid, My God, thou ſhalt preſerue my ſoule euen when I am dead. When our Lorde Ieſus ſpeaketh after this ſort, it is as muche as if hée aſſured vs all, that wee cannot doe amiſſe in ſubmitting our ſelues vnto our GOD, ſéeing that hée, for the defending of vs, vouchſafeth to take the charge of vs, and that we ſhall neuer periſh vnder his hand Now, we haue eftſoones to conſider, that when Ieſus Chriſt ſaide, Into thy handes O Lorde I commend my ſpirite, that hee obteined this priuiledge which Saint Stéeuen gaue him in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth of the Acts,<note place="margin">Acts. <hi>7.</hi>59.</note> which is, hée was made the preſeruer of all our ſoules. For what was it that S. Stéeuen ſaide when hee went to his death? Forſooth theſe were his wordes, Into thy hands O Lorde I commende my ſpirite. And héere wée ſée, that Saint Stéeuen ſhewed the benefite of the requeſt, which Ieſus Chriſte made: to wit, that wée may nowe come vnto him, and that wee
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:7663:82"/> ought to doe ſo, declaring that ſince God his Father had made him a Shephearde for vs, that wee ſhoulde not doubt but to bée at peace, come life, come death, knowing that all ſhall bee for our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, and turne to our benefite: and as Saint Paule ſaieth, that when hee had Ieſus Chriſte, hee had riches enough,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.21.</note> and cared nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for life nor death: for all ſhoulde be gayne vnto him. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let vs nowe learne, that when death ſhall aſſaile vs, that Ieſus Chriſte hath broken the ſting, which might haue ſtoong vs deadly to the heart, and that death ſhall no longer hurte vs, and that when our Lorde Ieſus yéelded vp his Spirite vnto God his Father, it was not onely to haue it conſerued in his owne perſon, but that hee myght haue this Priuiledge that ours might bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued eftſoones by the power of this requeſt, whenas wee ſhall come vnto him, as vnto one vnder whoſe protection we cannot pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſhe, as hee himſelfe declareth. And this is that triumph wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee haue ſpoken, which alreadie profiteth vs. For our Lorde Ieſus ſheweth howe precious his death is, when as hee went ſo fréely vnto his Father, as that wee might bee brought vnto him, and to ſhewe vs the way. But the principall point is this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wee might vnderſtande what benefite wée receiue thereby, becauſe he hath cancelled the Obligation that was againſt vs, that hée hath ſo purchaſed full ſatiſfaction for our ſinnes, as that wee may bee bolde to come before God his Father, ſo that death it ſelfe is no way able to harme nor hurt vs. And although wee ſee many thinges in vs which might make vs afearde, through the féeling of our miſeries, let vs not for all that ceaſe to glory in him who ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed himſelfe for vs, to the ende hée myght rayſe vs vp with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And although there is nothing in vs but ſhame and rebuke, yet, ſéeing that Ieſus Chriſte hung vpon the Croſſe, God woulde haue him by the mouth of Pilate to bee called a King. And ſo, although the kingdome of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte is nothing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtéemed of héere in this worlde, yet let vs account it to bée the foundation of all our glory, and let vs alſo vnderſtande that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wée be put to ſhame vnder his conduct, yet that wee haue whereof to reioyce, becauſe our eſtate ſhall be alwayes bleſſed, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as, that whatſoeuer miſeries, afflictions, and rebukes wée ſhall abide are more honorable and precious before God, then all
<pb facs="tcp:7663:83"/> the Scepters, pompes, and the moſt honourable thinges wherein wée take any pleaſure and delight. Thus wée ſée how wee muſt come vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, and ſo ſtick vnto him, as that we might vnderſtand of what valure the riches are which he brin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geth vs, but eſpecially, when hée, guideth vs by his Goſpell, let vs forſake all the commodities and pleaſures of this world, and alſo abhorre them, whenas they ſhal withdrawe vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the right way. To be ſhort, let our Lord Ieſus haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honor which he deſerueth, &amp; let not vs for our parts be like vnto Réedes carried w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery wind: but being eſtabliſhed in him, let vs call vpon God, &amp; we ſhall haue victory ouer life &amp; death, ouer which he hath alreadie triumphed. And beſides, let vs whiles we are yet in this worlde, yéeld him this honour, to wit, euen to acknowledge that he is our defender, which he will do, whenas we truly come vnto him, neither wil he, I ſay, doe it after an ordinary maner, but euen myraculouſly: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though death ſhoulde caſt vs downe headlong, yet is it his office to drawe vs out of it, and guide vs vnto the heauenly inheritance, which he ſo dearely hath purchaſed for vs.</p>
               <p>Let vs nowe fall downe before the Maieſtie of our good God, &amp; acknowledge our offences, beſéeching him that hee will make vs féele them otherwiſe then we haue done, And that we might bee ſo touched with the lothing of them, as that we might returne vnto our God with heartie repentance. And not for a day onely, but to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue it with ſighing and groning. And although we ſhall beheld within this priſon of bondage, yet let vs alwayes lift vp our harts vnto the heauens, and come familiarly vnto our God, ſince he is ſo enclined to mercy, and calleth vs of his owne accord, without tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying till wée ſéeke him. And when wée ſee that our Lorde Ieſus doeth not onely come néere vs, to the end he might declare this his loue vnto vs, but woulde be ſo abaſed for a time, as that he might lift vs aloft, ſo that we through faith ſhoulde not doubt to attaine thereto, tarrying and wayting vntill we be al come thither toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. That hée will not onely graunt vs this grace, but alſo all nations, &amp;c.</p>

Now, if all they that before had béen inſtructed by the Goſpell, had fallen away from it, whenas they ſée the ſonne of GOD put to death, a man woulde thinke that the preaching thereof had béen both vaine &amp; vnprofitable. And beſides, we know that the Apoſtles were choſen to this ſtate of life, to be as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe rulers in the Church. wherefore it is not like that this election of theirs, to this office and eſtate, was a vaine and friuolous thing.
<pb facs="tcp:7663:84"/> And therefore it is héere ſet downe vnto vs, that although the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles left this eſtat, wherin they ſhewed a beaſtly cowardlynes for Saint Peter himſelfe denied our Lord Ieſus, whereby he was as one cut of from all hope of our ſaluation, and worthy to bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as a rotten member, yet would not God ſuffer, that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel which they had before receiued, ſhould be quenched and vtterly aboliſhed.

For this was no trifling power that was in them whenas they would leaue their owne houſes to wander vp and downe hether and thither, both to their great pain, and ſhame alſo. And we know in what ſtate and condition our Lorde Ieſus ſtood, whiles he liued héere in this worlde. For thus he ſaith, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Foxes had holes, and the Birdes of the ayre neſtes, but that he,<note place="margin">Mat. 8.<hi>20.</hi>
                  </note> had no place wherin to hide his head. Contrarywiſe, we ſée, that theſe women had wherwith to liue quietly and pleaſantly.

Now, they alſo decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, euen at his death, the hope which they had had in our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus chriſt. For although their harts were dead as it were (as héer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhalbe declared more at full) and that they thought him to be

For, he had told them, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould reſtore the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God: &amp; he had alſo ſpoken vnto them of perfect bleſſednes, &amp; of the ſaluation which he muſt make an ende of. And what of all theſe things? forſooth, héereby we ſée, that although theſe ſéely wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens harts were ſore troubled, bicauſe they knew not what wold become of our Lord Ieſus, yet dyd he ſtrengthen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie power, &amp; in ende, brought it to ſo paſſe, as that they might both vnderſtand and iudge, that hee had made them no vaine promiſe. For, they looked for the promiſe of his reſurrection, which in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> iudg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of the world was not to be hoped of.

For we vnderſtand, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe was before that, ſo ambitiouſly carried, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe would haue had our Lord Ieſus ſit in his Kingly throane with all the pompe and brauery that might be, &amp; her ſonnes to ſit by him, as his two Lieftennaunts. For thus ſhe ſaid vnto him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 20.21</note> I beſeech thée Sir co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund that one of my ſons may ſit on thy right hand, and the other on thy left. Héere we ſée a fooliſhe glorious wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who woulde faine haue ſéene her children in ſome gliſtringe earthly tryumph.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7663:85"/>
               <p>But beholde ſhe ſaw héere a farre other manner of Schole: for ſhe ſaw our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt hanging vpon the Croſſe, ſo ſhamful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and reprochefully as that all the worlde was againſt him: and there, honge, as if God had curſed and forſaken him. And thus wée ſee, that when we ſhall bee brought vnto ſuch a ſhame, as that our mindes ſhal be terrifyed with feare &amp; gréefe, that God then taketh from vs all earthly affections, to the ende we might not be hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from lifting vp our mindes vnto heauen and to the ſpirituall lyfe, wherunto we muſt attaine. Which we ſhall neuer be able to come vnto, except we be cleanſed of al whatſoeuer kepeth vs back, héere below. Thus we ſée what we are to conſider of touchinge theſe women.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iho.</hi> 19.26.</note> And yet for all that, the meaning is not but that there were men alſo (for we know that our Lord ſpake vnto Iohn and comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded his mother vnto him). But the intent &amp; purpoſe of the holy ghoſt was to ſet héere ſuch a mirror or glaſſe before vs, to the ende we might vnderſtand that it was God who guided theſe women by his holy ſpirit by which hee would ſet forth his power and grace, by chooſinge, in mennes iudgementes ſuche féeble and weake inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. The like was alſo ſeene in Nicodemus, and in Ioſeph. Indéede S. Matthew, S. Luke, and S. Marke, make me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of none but of Ioſeph, becauſe it was he that came to Pilat, &amp; thervpon, Nicodemus tooke hart, when hee ſée himſelfe to haue ſo good a guide. True it is that Nicodemus was a Doctor of great eſtimation: and Ioſeph of Arimathea was a riche man, and of hie calling, and a Counſailor alſo (as héere it is ſaid) But yet let vs ſée whether their zeale was ſuch as that they would geue their liues for our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt or not, and whether they had in their life time forſaken their houſes to follow him.</p>
               <p>No, no, but when it came to that, that they muſt giue theyr liues, it was God that ſtirred them therto cleane contrary to all worldly iudgement. Héere then we ſée, that God hath made a ſtraunge and wonderfull alteration, in geuing this bouldneſſe to Ioſeph and Nycodemus, that they feared not the rage of the people, when they came to bury our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Before time, Nyco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus came in the night for feare of being euill ſpoken of, and yet when it was growne euen now to the worſt,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.2.</note> he burieth him. And therfore it cannot be choſen but that God gaue him a new harte: for he came before cloſely, &amp; there was no darkneſſe dark ynough,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7663:85"/> conſidering his fearefullneſſe and cowardize, if God had not corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted this fault in him. To be ſhort we ſee, what good the death of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte hath done, in that he then powred out the graces of his holy ſpirite, vpon theſe wretched people, who neuer before durſt declare their faith, nor yet render a reaſon thereof. Wherefore, they doe not onely confeſſe it with their mouth, but that which they did, ſheweth that they had rather bee accounted curſed before the worlde, then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they would not be the diſciples of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and ſo the thing which they had before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, to wit, the free ſaluation which was ſet before them. And héere we alſo ſée, why it is namely ſaid, that Ioſeph <hi>looked for the kingdome of God.</hi> Now by theſe woordes wée are tolde that God hath forſaken vs, and we are baniſhed his kingdome, vntyll ſuch time as hée gathereth vs vnto himſelfe as his people, in the name of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. Wherefore, wée ſée how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable our eſtate is, vntill our Lorde Ieſus calleth vs vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to conſecrate vs vnto God his father. And if this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite bée taken away from vs, curſed and confounded are we.</p>
               <p>Nowe, this then was a wonderfull power &amp; ſtrength to waite for the kingdome of God, becauſe the Iewes were made Baſtards vnto it, and in the opinion of the worlde, the occaſions therof were very great. For the Prophets had foretold, that at the returne of the people out of Babylon,<note place="margin">Agge. <hi>2.</hi>10.</note> that God woulde become ſuch a redée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vnto them: that his kingdome ſhould floriſh moſt honorably &amp; that the temple ſhould be built more gloriouſly then euer before it was: that they ſhould inioy al the pleaſures that might be, &amp; lead a moſt bleſſed life, that all men ſhould be in quiet, &amp; no talk be had but of reioyſing in God, of bleſſing his name, and of yéelding him praiſe, &amp; thanſgiuing. And this is it which the Prophets promiſed. But how fared it with the people? Forſooth their neighbours dyd eate &amp; drinke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp, they gréeued, &amp; vexed them, &amp; there was ſuch tyranny vſed, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t blood was ſpilt throughout al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> towne, the booke of the law burnt, &amp; euery man forbidden vpon paine of death not once to read it, &amp; ſuch cruelties co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, as were horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The temple alſo was altogether polluted. And what became of the houſe of Dauid? Forſooth, it was cut cleane downe, &amp; at laſt: the whole ſtate became worſe &amp; worſe. And therfore no maruel, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſo rude a people &amp; ſo giuen ouer to all their deſires &amp; luſtes,
<pb facs="tcp:7663:86"/> had not almoſt fallen from the true religion, and béen cleane out of heart: becauſe we ſée that the number of thoſe which paciently ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.25.36 <hi>Mat. 2.</hi>19.</note> and were conſtant in faith, were very rare and fewe. And of this number were Simeon, Anna the Propheteſſe, and Ioſeph. But what? The holy Ghoſt ſetteth downe vnto vs in ſo great a multitude, amongeſt the Iewes, and in a countrie ſo notably peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, foure or fiue, as a thing which was not ordinary, and witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that it were they onely who looked for the kingdome of God: and it was to this end, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we might learne, that when things were confounded &amp; in a deſperate caſe, that we ſhould then looke ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon God. And becauſe his trueth is infallible &amp; vnchangeable, let vs bée conſtant vnto the end, &amp; ouercome all troubles, offences, and griefes of the world, neither let vs when we ſigh &amp; grone, ceaſe to go on whither our Lord calleth vs, which is, let vs paciently abide vntyll his kingdome bée eſtabliſhed in vs, and in the meane while let it ſuffice vs that hée hath giuen vs a pawne from his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirite, by which hee witneſſeth vnto vs our frée adoption. And therefore, when God ſheweth, that hee taketh vs for his children, and engraueth the ſame in our heartes by his holy Spirite: and beſides, when wée haue the doctrine of the Goſpell dayly ſounding in our eares, Let our faith be confirmed, and let vs not ſlyde, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it all thinges were ſo confounded, as could not be poſſibly be more wiſhed. And thus wee ſée what it is that we haue to conſider of out of this place. Wee are alſo to note the thing that Saint Iohn reciteth before our Lord Ieſus was taken from the croſſe: to wit, that hée was thruſt into the ſide, to ſée whether he had yéelded vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ghoſte or not. For they haſtened not his death ſo faſt, as they dyd the two Théeues: But when they thought him to bee dead, they thruſt a Speare into him: and then they knewe that he was dead: which pleaſed well the ſouldiers.</p>
               <p>Now it is true, that if we ſhoulde not be able to bring in the lawe for a teſtimonie, we ſhould haue ſomewhat a cold pull of it, But S. Iohn giueth vs a full proofe that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte was the true Paſchall Lambe, ſince he was, by the wonderfull prouidence and counſell of God, preſerued, that there was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone of him broken.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.46. <hi>Num. 9.</hi>12.</note> For it ſaid in Exodus, that the Paſchal lambe ſhould bée eaten, but there ſhould not one bone of him bée broken. And why were not the bones of Ieſus Chriſte cruſhed? ſince it
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:7663:86"/> was the common maner at thoſe dayes. Surely, their will was not to ſpare him, and hée was hanged betwéene two Théeues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thought him to be the moſt vyle and deteſtable perſon. Wée ſée then héere, that this was the worke of God, in kéeping backe the handes of the Souldiers, and his will alſo was that his Sonne ſhould make a ſpéedie diſpatch, to the ende hée woulde pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue him, and that it might bée an euident ſigne vnto vs in this place, that in him the trueth of this auncient figure ſhoulde be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. Héere then are wée to obſerue, that the bones of the Sonne of God were preſerued from breaking, becauſe we might take him for our Paſchall Lambe, who ſhoulde preſerue vs from the wrath of God, whenas wée are marked with his blood. And therefore muſt wée come to this point: that ſince he is our Paſchall Lamb, wée muſt eftſoones bee dewed and ſprinckled with his blood: for without that, the ſhedding of it will doe vs no good: But when we ſhall accept him with this Sacrifice, and ſéeke remiſſion of our ſinnes alſo thereby, becauſe we know that vntyll hée hath waſhed and cleanſed vs, wée are very filthie, then are wee be dewed with his blood, through the ſpinckling of the holy ghoſt vpon our ſoules, and ſo are made cleane: and God accepteth and taketh vs for his people, and we are aſſured that although his wrath and vengeance bée ouer all the worlde, yet looketh hée on vs with his eye of mercy and alloweth vs for his children. Wée ſée then in this place, what wée are to conſider, when it is ſaide, That the bones of our Lorde Ieſus were not broken, to the end we might vnderſtand, that the thing which was declared by figure in the law, was verified in his body. And beſides, it is alſo ſaide, <hi>That water and blood iſſued out of his ſide, and hee that ſawe it, beare witneſſe thereof.</hi> When wée ſée that water &amp; blood iſſued ſo out, wée muſt remember that it was hee, as Saint Iohn ſayeth in his Canonicall Epiſtle,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5.6.</note> who by his ſacrifice wrought our purgation and peace, for the blotting out of all our ſinnes. In very déede, Blood, when one is dead, wil waxe thicke by nature, and from it will very thinne water come, becauſe the colour and thickeſt of the blood wil goe from it. But howeuer it is, Saint Iohn ſaieth, that GOD woulde ſhewe for what cauſe the death of his ſonne profiteth vs, to wit,<note place="margin">Heb. <hi>9.</hi>2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> in the firſt place, hée is at peace with vs by reaſon of the ſhedding of blood, for as it is ſaide, There can bée no remiſſion of ſinnes
<pb facs="tcp:7663:87"/> without the effuſion of blood. For beholde why Sacrifices were v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the beginning of the worlde. And God hath ſaide, that hée would be mercifull to all miſerable ſinners which put their truſte in him: But yet he woulde haue ſacrifices to bee offered, as if hée ſhould haue ſaid, that men ſhould be fréely forgiuen their ſinnes, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe they can bring nothing of their own with them to obteine it. But muſt haue a mediator to recompence it. Wée ſée then that the blood which ranne downe from the ſide of our Lorde Ieſus, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth vnto vs, that the Sacrifice which hée offered, was a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for all our iniquities, ſo that we are diſcharged of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. True it is we muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually féele our ſelues to be gilty that we might bée humbled, and brought to true repentance, and bée cléerely voide of all preſumption. But howeuer it is, wée are aſſured that God acquitteth and pardoneth vs in the name of his ſonne, when we come to acknowledge our ſinnes and iniquities. And why ſo? Becauſe the ſacrifice of his death is ſufficient, to blot out the memory of al our tranſgreſſions. It is the water then that cleanſeth. Wherefore, to the end we might be waſhed from all our ſpots, let vs vnderſtande, that the meaning of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte was that water ſhoulde iſſue out of his ſide, to declare that hée is in very déede our puritie, and that wée muſt ſéeke for none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remedy to waſhe vs from all our filthineſſe. And thus wée ſée howe water and blood came from him, by which meane wee are throughly ſaued in him, and therefore muſt make no wandleſſes, to ſéeke our ayde els where. But when wée ſhall conſider more néerely of the matter, wée ſhall ſée a very notable ſimilitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the blood and the water which iſſued out of the ſide of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, and the Sacraments of the Church, in which the thing that was perfourmed in his death is allowed and ſealed vnto vs. For after hée had ſuffered whatſoeuer was requiſite for our ſaluation, and fully ſatiſfied GOD his Father, by ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng, and purchaſing vs full righteouſneſſe, hée would that all the whole matter ſhould bée witneſſed vnto vs, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two ſacraments of his owne inſtitution. I ſpeake of two: becauſe there are no moe inſtituted in his worde, But Baptiſme, and the Supper. For all the reſte is but a vaine imagination, deuiſed by the raſhe bolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men. Thus wee ſee that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7663:87"/> powreth out the vertue of his death and paſſion, aſwel vpon Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, as on the holy Supper. For Baptiſme is a witneſſe vnto vs, that hée hath ſo waſhed and cleanſed vs from all our filthineſſe, as that God receiueth vs vnto his fauour, as if wée came cleane and neate before him.</p>
               <p>Now, wée muſt vnderſtand that the water in Baptiſme wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not this effect. For howe can a corruptible Element waſhe and cleanſe our ſoules? But the matter is, becauſe water iſſued out of the ſide of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. And therefore, when wée woulde that Baptiſme ſhould doe vs good, let vs goe vnto him who was crucified for vs, and when we would féele the fruit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, let vs runne vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who would haue vs ſéeke for euerie parte and parcell of our ſaluation in him, without wandring and whéeling hither and thither. And beſides, wée haue in the holie Supper a teſtimony, that Ieſus Chriſt is our Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, and that vnder the bread, and wine, hée preſenteth vnto vs his bodie and blood. Héere then wée ſée the whole perfection of our ſaluation, when as wée are thus cleanſed, and that God accepteth vs as if wée were pure, and righteous, and are ſo acquited before him as giltleſſe, becauſe our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt hath made full ſatiſfaction for vs. Thus we ſée howe wée muſt profite by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes, by directing our whole fayth vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and not to encline vnto creatures. Wée ſée alſo howe wée ought to be confirmed by the ſuffring of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and let it be alwayes freſhe in our mindes, when as God ſheweth vs euen to our faces, of what valure the iſſuing out of blood &amp; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the ſide of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, is. And ſo, this is in ſumme the thing which we are to conſider of, concerning the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the ſide of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. And beſides, when it is ſaide, That the Scripture was accompliſhed, let vs vnderſtand, that this was ſpoken long before this time, that all was gouerned by the ſecrete Councell of God: and although the Souldiers knew not what they did, yet God effectually executed that which he had ſpoken, aſwell by Moſes, as by his Prophet Zachary. Wée haue alreadie ſéene the teſtimony of Exodus: and Saint Iohn hath alſo put too the ſaying of the Prophet Zachary, whoſe words are theſe. They ſhall ſee him whom they had perced. In déede God vſeth in that a ſimilitude: For,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.20.</note> hée ſetteth him ſelfe againſt the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb facs="tcp:7663:88"/> of his worde, whoſe heartes were rebelliouſly and wickedly hardened. Well (ſaieth hée) they thinke they make warre agaynſt the Preachers of my word, and that they may by this meane ſtop them. Notwithſtanding, it is againſt mée they fight, and whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they contemne and refuſe my word after this maner: it is as if they wounded me with the ſtabbe of a dagger: and ſo ſhal they ſée him who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had perſed. But this was truely accompliſhed in the perſon of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, for they perſed him in his mortal body. And thus we ſée how he was manifeſted to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> liuing God, who was in all ages ſpoken of by his Prophetes, ſince we ſée that whatſoeuer was ſpoken, was accompliſhed in his perſon. Now, it is afterward ſaid, that when Ioſeph had obteined of Pilate to take away the bodie of Ieſus from the Croſſe, to bury him, that he tooke a cleane linnen ſhéete, and bought ſwéete ointments alſo (which as S. Iohn ſaieth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 19.39.</note> coſt a great ſumme of mony) of Myrrhe and Aloes, and buried him in a new Tombe, which hée had newe made and heawen out of a rocke. In this Sepulcher or Tombe, our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt firſt began to ſhew the iſſue of his death: which was, that hée ſhoulde verie ſpéedely glorifie himſelfe in his reſurrection, and it was the will of God eftſoones to manifeſt it. And here we ſée an infallible teſtimony, that amongeſt ſo many confuſions which we read in this hiſtory, that might trouble vs, and as it were ſhake our Fayth, we may perceiue that God had alwayes care of his onely Sonne, as of the head of his Church, and of his welbelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: not to the end onely that we ſhould truſt in him, but that wée ſhould alſo by litle &amp; litle looke vnto it, that ſince we are the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his bodie, that the Fatherly care of God will ſtretch it ſelf not onely vnto vs, but alſo to euery one els which truſt in him. But by the way, this queſtion might be aſked, why our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus would be ſo ſumptuouſly buried. For it ſhould ſéeme, that it was a ſuperfluous thing, to vſe the coſtlineſſe of Aloes &amp; Myrrhe, and ſuch lyke. And to ſay the trueth, what profiteth this a dead man, to be waſhed, and annointed, or to haue any other glorious ſhew.</p>
               <p>And therfore a man would think, that this agreed not with the doctrine of the Goſpell, where as it is ſaide, that wée ſhall bée ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp agayne at the latter day, by the wonderfull power of our
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7663:88"/> God. Wherefore, it ſéemeth that all thoſe pompes ſhoulde be naught ſet by, and be cleane forgotten. And héerevpon it might be thought, that Ioſeph his religion was but fooliſh, which ſhould darken the hope of the reſurrection. Howbeit wée haue héere to note, that the Iewes vſed theſe kinde of Ceremonies, vntill the time our Lord Ieſus Chriſt had accompliſhed all whatſoeuer was requiſite for our ſaluation. And the buryall at thoſe dayes were as the Sacrifices, waſhinges, and lightes of the Temple, and ſuch lyke. And becauſe they were rude people, it was méete they ſhould be handled like yong children. In verie déed, buryall was taken to be an holie thing all the world ouer, and it was the wil of God, that it ſhould be engrauen in the heartes of the verie paganes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they might haue no excuſe, when as they would be ſo beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as not to hope for a better lyfe. Nowe, the Paganes abuſed the ſame: But be as be may, it will be caſt in their téethes at the latter day, that they were ouer curious in the burying of the dead, for there was not ſo barbarous a nation in the world, which made not great account thereof. And yet they knew not why they did ſo, no more then they knew the meaning of their ſacrifices: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, this is enough to condemne them, inſomuch as they departed from the trueth of God, and corrupted the teſtimony that was giuen them, which ſhould haue brought them to the beliefe of the heauenly lyfe. But howeuer it is, The Buriall of it ſelfe, was alwayes as a myrror of the reſurrection: For they put the bodie into the grounde, to be kept for a time. For if there were no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, it were no matter if they had been caſt out of the dores to haue bin eaten of Dogs, or wilde beaſts: But they honourably buried them, that they might not be pulde in péeces, although they were ſure, they turned to duſt. In déede the Iewes obſerued ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ceremonies. And yet the Egyptians farre paſſed them: But this their great ſorrowing, lamenting, and tearing of their haire, were all but bragges. This then was the manner of the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, whom the Deuill had bewitched, becauſe they peruerted all good order. But the Buriall of the Iewes, ſtrengthened their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of the reſurrection. And ſo, according to that which I haue ſaide, our Lorde Ieſus would be buried after the auncient faſhion, becauſe hée had not as yet, by his reſurrection, fully accompliſhed our ſaluation.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7663:89"/>
               <p>This is true, that at his death, the vayle of the Temple rent in ſunder, wherein God ſhewed, that that was the ende and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all thinges<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and that the figures and ſhadowes of the lawe ſhould laſt no longer. Howbeit the world ſée not this, neither was any man able to conceiue, that all the figures of the lawe, were ended in Ieſus Chriſt. And therefore his will was to be buried. And thus much for this point. Let vs now alſo vnderſtand, that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt hath purchaſed vs life by his reſurrection, ſo that wee muſt goe ſtrait to him, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out ſéeking any other meanes to direct vs, then ſuch as hée hath aſſigned vs. We haue alſo alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſaide, that hée hath ordeined two Sacramentes for our better confirmation. If the manner of the Iewes buriall had béen neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie for vs, no doubt, Ieſus Chriſt would haue had it continue in his Church. But hée would not that we ſhould ſtay our ſelues vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this earthly and childiſh Elements. And therfore it is enough for vs to vſe the plaine order of burying, &amp; leaue the ſwéet ointments which figure vnto vs the reſurrection, and was manifeſted in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Wherefore we ſhould but ſeparate our ſelues from him, if we would be thus baſely and ſimply inſtructed. For marke what Saint Paul ſaieth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.2.</note> That if our affection be on things aboue, we muſt ſéeke it in fayth and in ſpirit, and be conioyned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt:<note place="margin">Coloſ. <hi>12.</hi>8.9. &amp; <hi>18.</hi>
                  </note> that we ſhould bend our ſelues to him, and not be nuſſeled in any thing which might withdraw, hinder, or kéepe vs backe from being vnited to him as vnto our head, ſince his body is ſaid to be the Temple of God. And thus much wée are to conſider of for buryall. Howbeit this is alſo to be remembred, that hée was laide in a <hi>newe Tombe,</hi> which was not made, but by the ſingular prouidence of God: For he might verie wel haue béen buried in a Tombe which had ſerued for that purpoſe long before. For Ioſeph of <hi>Arimathea</hi> had many aunceſtors, and in ſuch weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy mens houſes, there was a commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Tombe made for the nonce. Notwithſtanding, God had otherwiſe prouided for the matter, and would haue our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt to be laide in a newe Tombe, wherin neuer man had béen laide. Neither was it without cauſe that hée was called the firſt fruites of the reſurrection, and the firſt borne of the dead: who had béen made partakers of life before our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. For we read that Lazarus roſe again. Wée ſée alſo that Enock &amp; Elie were taken vp, and neuer felt any naturall
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7663:89"/> death, but were gathered together into an incorruptible life: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>béeit al this hangeth vpon the reſurrection of our Lord Ieſus. And therfore we muſt take him to be as the firſt fruites. In the law, the fruites of the yéere were conſecrated to GOD, by the only brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of an eare of Corne, and a bunche of Grapes, to lay vpon the Au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter. Now when this was offered to God, it was a generall conſecrating of al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruits of the yéere. When y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt born alſo were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated to God, it was a declaratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holines of the tribe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, &amp; that God accompted it for his inheritaunce, which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued to himſelfe, and contented himſelfe with this people, as if a man would be contented with his Patrimonie, Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo, let vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when we come to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, we are al co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated and offered in his perſon, to the end we might at this day, receiue life through death, &amp; that it ſhould no more be deadly as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was. And thus we ſée what we are to obſerue as concerning the new Tombe: that is, that the buriall of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt muſt bring vs vnto his reſurrection.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe let vs looke wel to our ſelues: for al whatſoeuer that muſt ſerue our faith, hath béene accompliſhed in the perſon of the Sonne of GOD: And although wée haue a ſure teſtimonie that it is ſufficient for vs, yet by reaſon of our groſeneſſe &amp; weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wée are very farre from comming vnto Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. And therefore let euery of vs which acknowledge our offences, ſéeke remedy for them, &amp; be of good courage. For we ſée how Ioſeph &amp; Nicodemus did. Now, here are two things to be conſidered of for our example. The firſt is, that they had no cléere inſight in the fruite of the death and paſſion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their vnderſtanding was groſſe, and their faith very weake. The other is, that notwithſtanding this extremitie, yet fought they againſt all temptations, and came to looke for our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt who was dead, to put him into the Tumbe, proteſting that they hoped to come to the bleſſed reſurrection which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them. And although we feele our ſelues weake, yet let it not diſcourage vs. It is true indéed, that we are weake, and God may reiect vs, when as hée ſhal roughly entreate vs. But yet when we ſhall féele theſe wantes, let vs vnderſtand that he will accept our deſire, although it be imperfect.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, ſince at this day, our Lorde Ieſus is riſen in glory,
<pb facs="tcp:7663:90"/> and although we muſt here ſuffer many miſeries and calamities, and that a man would thinke he were daily crucified in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as in déed, the vngodly as much as in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lieth doe: yet let not vs quayle for al this, becauſe we knowe that we cannot be put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide that, which is promiſed vs in the doctrine of the Goſpel: and although wee muſt runne through a number of afflictions, yet let vs alwayes haue an eye vnto our heade. For Ioſeph and Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus neuer had the aduantage that wée at this day haue, which is, they neuer beheald the power of the ſpirite of God, which is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the reſurrection of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and yet was not their faith for all this wholly morgaged. And ſince our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus calleth vs now vnto him, and telleth vs allowde that hée is aſcended into heauen, to the ende he might gather vs altogether, let vs conſtantly perſeuere both to ſéeke him, and follow him, and that it is no hurt for vs to die with him, ſince we ſhalbe partakers of his glory. And Saint Paule exhorteth vs to be like vnto Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, not onely as touching his death, but alſo as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his buriall. For there are ſome that coulde bée contented to die w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our Lord Ieſus Chriſt for a minute of an houre, but it wold grieue them to doe it any longer. And for this cauſe I haue ſayde, that wée muſt not die for a while, but wée muſt alſo paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently abide, at laſt to be buried. I call this dying, whenas God ſéeth vs ſo ſuffer for his names ſake: for although wée bée not at the firſt, condemned, and brought to the ſtake, yet when wée are afflicted, this is a kinde of death which wée muſt paciently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde. But becauſe wée are not by and by humbled, it is méete wée ſhoulde bée longer time ſcourged, and bée contented, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently beare it. For as the Diuel neuer ceaſeth to deuiſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer may withdrawe vs, and make vs growe woorſe and woorſe: Euen ſo muſt wée al our life long fight againſt him. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this be a very hard and grieuous condition, yet let vs ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry til the time bee come, that God calleth vs vnto him, and not bée wéery in confeſſing our fayth, and therein followe Nicodemus, but not in his temerouſnes. For when he firſt came vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, hée kept himſelfe very couert and cloſe, and was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fearde to ſhewe himſelfe a true Diſciple (for wée knowe that the confeſſion of our faith is required in vs)<note place="margin">Iohn. 2. &amp; 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> But when hée came to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7663:90"/> bury him, he declared, and confeſſed that he was of the number of the faithfull company. Wherefore ſince he did ſo, let vs at this day follow his conſtancy. And although the worlde hateth and deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt and the doctrine of his Goſpell, yet let vs ſtick vnto it. Let vs alſo vnderſtande, that the greateſt benefite and contentation that wee can continuallye haue is this, whenas God accepteth and liketh of our ſeruice, and beſides, although wée muſt ſuffer &amp; abide troubles here in this worlde, yet let vs knowe this y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> becauſe he hath gloryouſly ryſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againe, that he dyd it not to the ende to make a ſeparation betwéene him and vs, but that hee would when he ſée his good time gather vs vnto him ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, let vs not maruell although our Lorde Ieſus roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the third day: for it is very good reaſon that hee ſhould haue ſome more priuiledge then the common order of the church.</p>
               <p>And héerein is the ſaying of the Pſalmiſt fulfilled. Thou ſhalt not ſuffer thine holy one to ſée corruption.<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.<hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> And therefore it was méete that the body of our Lord Ieſus ſhould remaine vncorrupt vntill the third day: but it was for that time, ſo appoynted and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed by the counſell of GOD his Father. Howbeit wee, haue no time aſſigned, but the laſt day. And therefore let vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byde troubles and miſeries ſo long as it pleaſeth GOD, and let vs vnderſtand that he wyll in the ende, when hee ſéeeth conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time, reſtore vs, after wee haue bene caſt quite and cleane downe, For therevnto Saint Paul exhorteth vs,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10.</note> when as hée ſaieth, that Chriſt Ieſus is the firſt fruites: whiche is, to pull backe that feruent zeale wherewith wee are often times too too much carryed awaye: for by our wylles wee woulde flye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out winges, and wee are gréeued with God for houldinge vs ſo longe heere in this worlde, becauſe hée wyll not bringe vs to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen euen at the fyrſt,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Kin.</hi> 2.<hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> and carry vs vp in a fiery Charit as Eilas was: to be ſhort, we would faine triumph before we haue fought a blow.</p>
               <p>Now, that we might withſtand this deſire, and theſe fooliſh luſts, Saint Paul telleth vs that Ieſus Chriſt is the firſt fruites, &amp; wée muſt be contented that by his death we haue a ſure pawne of the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Neuertheles, bicauſe he ſitteth at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of god his Father hauing all rule and dominion both in heauen and earth:
<pb facs="tcp:7663:91"/> and although his maieſtie hath not as yet appeared, and that our life is hid in him, let vs become like wretched dead people, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we ſéeme to be liuing héere in this world, yet let vs bée as men quite forlorne: and abide all this, vntill the comming of our Lord Ieſus: For euen then ſhall our life be made manifeſt by him, when as he ſhall thinke it good. And thus we ſée what it is that wée muſt obſerue about the buriall of our lord Ieſus Chriſt, vntil ſuch time, as we attaine to the reſt, which will be a declaration, that he hath not onely made ſatiſfaction for all our ſinnes, but alſo hath by his victorie, obteined all perfect righteouſneſſe for vs, by whiche meane we are become acceptable at this day vnto the maieſtie of God, both to haue frée acceſſe vnto him, and alſo to call vpon his holie name.</p>
               <p>And in this confidence and beliefe, Let vs fall downe before his diuine maieſtie, beſéeching him to receiue vs all to his mercy, and that we may not ceaſe to haue recourſe vnto his frée goodnes, how miſerable &amp; wretched ſoeuer we bée. And although we dayly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke his heauy wrath and indignation againſt vs, and iuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue that hée ſhould forſake vs, Let vs patiently wayte vntill hée ſheweth the fruit and power of the death &amp; paſſion which his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sonne hath ſuffred, by which we are reconciled, and not doubt but that hée will be alwayes our Father, ſo long as hée wil graunt vs this fauour, as that we may be able to ſhew our ſelues his true children. Let vs alſo beſéech him that hée will cauſe vs to declare this by the effect, in ſuch ſort, as that we deſire nothing els but to be wholy his: and as hée hath very dearely bought vs, ſo wee may alſo of right, fully and wholly agrée to ſerue him. And forſomuch as our weakneſſe is ſuch, as that we are not able to diſcharge the hundreth part of our duetie, without hée worke it in vs by his holy ſpirite: becauſe the infirmities of our fleſh doe alwayes beare ſuch a reſiſting and ſtriuing ſway, as that we doe nothing els but euen créepe, where we ſhould in déede march as becommeth vs, Let vs beſéech him to ryd vs of all together, that we might be vnited to him by that holy bond which bée hath ordeined, to wit, our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt his onely Sonne. That hée will not onely graunt vs this grace, &amp;c.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Man would at the firſt ſight thinke it ſtraunge, that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt woulde ſhew him ſelfe after his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, rather to women, then vnto his Diſciples. Howbeit wee are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to conſider, that his meaning was to trye the baſeneſſe and lowlineſſe of our faith. Becauſe we muſt not build vpon mans wiſdome, but obedientlye receiue what ſoeuer we know to come from him. Againe, no doubt of it, his meaning was to correct his Diſciples, whenas he ſent women to teach them, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing which hee had taught them ſerued them to no purpoſe, when it came to the pinch. For beholde all the Diſciples were ſcattered, they forſooke their maiſter, and feare ouercame them. For what learned they for thrée whole yéeres together, in the ſchoole of the Sonne of God? And therefore ſuch frewandiſe deſerued great cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, euen to haue al the knowledge which they had before time receiued to be cleane taken away, becauſe they had troade it vnder foote, &amp; buried it. Now it was not the meaning of our Lorde Ieſus, to correct them ſharply, but to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amend their fault, by mild &amp; gentle correction, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he appointed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> women to be their School miſtreſſes. He had before, choſen them to preach the Goſpel all the worlde ouer (for they in very déede were the firſt Doctours of the Church) But becauſe they were ſuch Trewands and ſo buſie min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as that their faith was, as it were, laide aſoke or ſaped, it was good reaſon they ſhould vnderſtand that they were not woorthy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie more to heare our Lord Ieſus Chriſt preache. And héere we ſée the cauſe why they were ſent backe to women, vntill ſuch time as they had better acknowledged their offences, &amp; that our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt of his méere fauour &amp; grace had ſet them againe in their eſtate and degrée. And beſides (as I haue already ſayd) we are all generally aduertiſed, to receiue the teſtimonie which God ſendeth vs, and it were by the mouthes of men of ſlender quality, &amp; of no credit &amp; eſtimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the world, for we indéed ſée, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whatſoeuer hée is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is choſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; appointed to be a regiſter or publike perſon, that the thing which he doth, is receiued for autenticall. Neither will men ſay one thing or another againſt him: becauſe al men reuerence the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7663:92"/> office which he hath. And ſhall God haue leſſe preheminence then earthly princes, ſhal not he ordaine ſuch as pleaſeth him, to be his witneſſes, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whoſe mouthes wée ſhould receiue whatſoeuer they ſhal ſay without gainſaying? ſurely, furely it is good reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſhould be ſo, except we would become rebels againſt God himſelfe. Héere then we ſée, what it is that wée muſt conſider of in the firſt place. Moreouer, let vs alſo note &amp; marke that although our Lord Ieſus appeared to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> women, which was a very honorable thing vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yet himſelf not long after, ſufficiently teſtified his reſurrection. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that if we cloſe not vp our eyes, ſtop our eares, and become maliciouſly hard hearted, and blockiſh,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.6.</note> wée are fully aſſured of this Article of our faith, which is of great importaunce. For when S. Paule rebuked the infidelity of thoſe that ſtoode as yet in doubt of the reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt, hée brought not in only women, but alſo Peter and Iames and all the twelue Apoſtles, &amp; fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth Diſciples moe, vnto whom our Lord Ieſus Chriſt appeared Which way then are wée able to excuſe our ſelues of our wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe &amp; rebellion, if wée credit not aboue fiue hundreth witneſſes, whom God himſelfe hath appoynted for the ſame purpoſe. Neither did our Lord Ieſus Chriſt declare vnto them only once,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.14</note> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hée was aliue, but euen many times. And therfore the doubt and incredit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which was in the Apoſtles ought to confirme vs a great deale the more:<note place="margin">Luk. <hi>24.</hi>25.</note> for if they at the firſt had beléeued that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt was riſen againe, it might haue byn ſaid that they had bene ouerlight of credit.</p>
            <p>Howbéeit, they were ſo ſlow of beliefe, as that it was méet our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſhould find fault with their blockiſhnes &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſnes, &amp; beſides, they were ſo groſe &amp; carnally minded, as that they could vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d nothing. Since the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apoſtles ſo hardly could come to this article of our faith y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame ought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rather co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firm vs: for ſeing they were brought to it, as it were by force, it is very good reaſon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> we at this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſhould follow this ſaying, Thomas,<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:7663:93"/> vnto God, who is worthy of all ſuperioritie ouer vs, and be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent vnto his word. For, if we be not teachable, it is out of al doubt, that we ſhall neuer profyt our ſelues by the doctrine of the Goſpell neither muſt we accompt it, for fooliſhnes, which we receiue from the mouth and teſtimony of God. And when wee ſhall learne to profyt by our obedience, in faith, and in his Schole, wee ſhall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that to be ſubiect to him, is the very perfection of all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>Let vs now come to the ſtory as it is héere deliuered vnto vs. It is ſayd, <hi>That Mary Magdalene, and her companion, came the firſt day of the Sabboth, to ſee the ſepulchre:</hi> to wit the firſt day in the wéek. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes kept the Sunday, which they called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſabboth, for the day of reſt, as indeede the worde ſo ſignifyeth, and beſides, they called all the dayes of the wéek following, the 1. day of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, the 2. day of the ſabboth, the 3. day of the ſabboth, &amp;c. Now, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the day began after the Sonne ſetting, it is ſaide, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the two Maries bought ſwéete oyntmetes, after the Sabboth was ended, and prepared themſelues to come the next day in the morning to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sepulchre. Howbeit they were more then two. Neuertheleſſe S. Iohn nameth Mary Magdalen only: but S. Matth. nameth two of them, and we ſée that S. Luke faith y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> there were a great number of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; yet al this agréeeth wel together: for Mary Magdalen led the way, and the other Mary is eftſoones named, bicauſe ſhe folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hard after Mary Magdalene. But by the way, there were many w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> came to annoint y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of our lord Ieſus: neuertheles, it is here namely ſayd, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was they which came to ſée whether they might enter the Sepulchre or not. We ſée then why theſe two were héere ſpecially marked. Howbeit S. Matth. ſaith that the Angel appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſince there were two of them: but becauſe one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> carried word, therfore it is ſo eſpecially named. In the end, as they were going thence, they met with our Lord Ieſus, who ſent them vnto his Diſciples, that they might all méete in Galile, entending to ſhew them that he was riſen againe: for ſomuch as the Citie of Ieruſalem had bereft it ſelfe of ſo notable a teſtimonie, by reaſon of their horible impietie. And yet for all that, it, ſtill remayned the fountayne of life: for out of it was the lawe, and the worde of God taught: neuertheleſſe, our Lord Ieſus Chriſt would not ſhew him ſelfe vnto his Diſciples in that Citie, ſéeinge the wickedneſſe of it
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7663:93"/> to be as yet ſo freſh in memory: and on the other ſide his meaning was to conforme him ſelfe vnto their groſneſſe: for they were as it were ſo amazed, as that lookes would not haue conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with out he had taken them aſide, and in ſuch ſort haue ſo ſhewed hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, as that they might haue bene fully ſatiſfyed. Howbeit we ſée that the women which are héere named, forgot not to reuerence our Lord Ieſus Chriſt as their maiſter, although they were great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubled with his death: whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may conſequently be iudged, that the word of God was déeply rooted in their harts: for although their faith was weake, yet ſought they for our Lorde Ieſus at the Sepulchre. And as for ignoraunce, it, could no waies excuſe them, bicauſe they ſhould haue lifted vp their minds into heauen, looking from thens, the reſurrection that was promiſed them ſéeing it was appointed out vnto them by name to be the third day. Now, their mindes were ſo occupied, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they could not comprehend the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall matter, to wit, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> our Lord Ieſus ſhould ouercome death, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might therby obtaine life and ſaluation for vs. I call it, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall poynt, becauſe that without it (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſayeth) the Goſpell ſhould haue bene in vaine, &amp; our fayth in vaine.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.14</note> Euen ſo although theſe poore women, had a good minde vnto the Sonne of GOD, and knew that the Goſpel whiche was preached vnto them, was the very truth: yet were they ſo troubled, and in ſuch a maze, as that they were not able to reache vnto the depth of his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and therfore came vnto the Sepulchre with their ſwéete oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Now, this was a falt worthy condemnation: and yet God accepted of their miniſtery: for he excuſed that, their amazedneſſe, vntil he had brought them back to the conſideration of the matter. Héereby we ſée, that when our Lorde alloweth of any thing we do, it is ſo farre of, that we ſhoulde make an accompte, that we haue deſerued any thinge, as that contrarywiſe, hée of his frée mercy and goodneſſe alloweth the thing, which inveridéede was not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be offered vnto him. For God may alwayes haue good oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to condemne our workes, if hee woulde ſtraightly examine them: becauſe they ſhall neuer be founde vnſpotted. Howbeit, God ſpareth vs, &amp; is contented to receiue the thing which we offer vnto him, be it neuer ſo weake and fauty: ſo that we deliuer it vp in an aſſured and pure faith, and acknowledge, that he accepteth vs, for Ieſus Chriſt his ſake.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7663:94"/>
            <p>And this is it which wée haue in this place to obſerue. But in the meane while, let vs alſo vnderſtand, that it was méete there ſhuld in the buriall of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, be another maner, and a better ſauour and of greater force, then all the ſwéete oyntmentes which are héere ſpoken of. We haue already ſaide, that the Iewes cuſtomably vſed to anoynt the bodies, for the confirmation of their hope in the reſurrection, and of the heauenly lyfe: which was a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification that the bodies did not ſo corrupt, but that they ſhoulde be preſerued vnto the laſt day, till God had reſtored them. But the body of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was clearly exempt from this corruption. Now, it was not the ſwéete baulmes which could doo it:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10.</note> but becauſe it was ſaid, that God would not ſuffer his holy one to ſee corruption, we ſée y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our Lorde Ieſus was by miracle preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And becauſe he was exempt from corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we are at this preſent, certen &amp; aſſured, of the glory of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which we haue already ſeene in his owne perſon: wherefore, wée ſée the ſwéet ſauour of the buriall &amp; reſurrection of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, hath ſo farre ſtretched out it ſelfe, as that wee are thereby quickned. What then remaineth there to be done? forſooth, let not vs ſéeke any longer for the Sepulchre, as theſe women did, whoſe ignoraunce and weaknes hath ſtoode vs in ſome ſtead: but let vs looke vp into heauen, ſince he calleth vs thither vnto him: and hath ſhewed vs the way thereto, and hath beſide declared vnto vs, that he hath taken poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his heauenly kingdom, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end he might make a roome &amp; place ready for vs,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14.2.</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we ſhal there ſeeke after him. Howbeit, we muſt alſo note the ſaying of S. Mat. for, <hi>the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>appeared, who ſo feared the Souldiers, as that they be came like dead men.</hi> The women alſo were in the like flight, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angel forthwith comforted them ſaying: <hi>feare you not,</hi> for I know yée ſéeke Ieſus which was crucified, he is riſen as he ſaide. Wée ſée héere how God, ſo accepteth, of the affection &amp; zeale of theſe wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he correcteth notwithſtanding, the thing which he miſlyketh. I meane, hee correcteth by the mouth of the Angell whom hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted there in his turne. We haue already ſayde that it procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of the ſinguler mercy and goodneſſe of God, whenas hee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth our imperfect miniſtery, which he might very wel abhor. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he receueth of vs y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing which is of no value, euen as a father taketh of his children many things in good part, which otherwiſe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7663:94"/> were very bables and trifles, Thus we ſée how liberally God dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with vs, and yet he woulde not haue vs pleaſe and flatter our ſelues in our ſinnes. Let vs therefore beholde how the Angell cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth theſe womens imperfection: &amp; although their drift was to a good ende, yet are they condemned of a perticuler vice whiche was in them. And loe, why S. Luke ſaith that they were moſt ſharplye rebuked: when it is ſaide,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.5</note> wherfore ſéeke you the liuing among the dead? but we are héere to obſerue, that the faithleſſe &amp; wicked ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who had no feare either of God, or of religion, were terrefied, &amp; became like mad men: indéede the women were alſo afeard, but they were foorthwith comforted. And thus we ſée how terrible the maieſty of God is to all thoſe vnto whom he ſheweth himſelfe, and he doth it becauſe we ſhould féele our fraylnes, whenas God mani<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſteth himſelfe vnto vs: and where before, we were preſumptuoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puffed vp, and ſo imbouldned, as that we thought our ſelues too be no mortall men, whenas God ſhewed vs any ſigne of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, therfore it was méete, that of neceſſitie we ſhould be confou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and be brought to acknowledge our eſtate to be but duſt &amp; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, &amp; al our vertues to be, but as ſlitting &amp; vaniſhing ſmoke. And this falleth out, both to good &amp; bad. Moreouer, when God terrifieth the faithles, he leueth them as reprobats, becauſe they are no way worthy to taſt of his goodnes. Wee alſo ſée, why they flye his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, why they ſet them ſelues againſt him, &amp; gnaſh their téethe, &amp; become ſo furious as that they are without all wit &amp; reaſon, &amp; doo become euen very brutiſh. But the faithfull although they bee ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, yet ar they reléeued, and take good courage, becauſe that God comforteth and gladdeth them. And therfore, the feare wherew<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the preſence of the maieſtie of God terrifieth the faithfull, is but a preparatiue to humble them, to the ende they might reuerence and obey him as he is worthy, and confeſſe themſelues to be nothinge, that they might looke for al their bleſſednes in him alone. Héere then we ſée why the Angell ſaide, <hi>feare not.</hi> Now, this ſayinge, is worthy the noting: for it is as muche as if hee had ſaide, I wyll clearely giue ouer theſe faithleſſe and ſcombe of the world, for they are not worthy of any mercye, and I direct my ſpeache vnto you, and bring you glad tidinges. Be not you therfore afeard, becauſe yée come to ſéeke Ieſus Chriſt. Nowe, when wee ſée this, let vs learne to ſéeke our Lorde Ieſus, but not (as I haue ſayde) thus
<pb facs="tcp:7663:95"/> groſely as theſe women of whom we haue ſpoken, did (as indéede there is now no occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſéeke the ſepulchre) but let vs go direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; without hipocyiſie vnto him by faith. And let vs vnderſtand, that this meſſage appertaineth to vs, and is ſpoken to vs, that wée might bouldly, and without feare come vnto him, and not in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous maner (for we ought to worſhip the maieſty of GOD in feare and trembling) but how euer it is, let vs not be ſo ſauadge, as though diſtruſt had oppreſſed vs. And therfore let vs vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that the ſonne of God will conforme him ſelfe like vnto vs, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we come vnto him by faith, yea and wee ſhall bee ſure to finde wherwith to comfort and glad our ſelues, becauſe he hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the kingdome and principalytie of euerlaſting life, for our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and welfare. And yet notwithſtandinge, <hi>the women departed quicklye with feare, and great ioy.</hi> Loe, how the weakneſſe of their faith appeared. I haue ſaide that the thing which they went about was to a good ende, but they kept not the right courſe: as may be ſéene by their feare, for they were not fully reſolued and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of the reſurrection. And yet they had hearde it many times ſpoken of: but their mindes were not ſo ſetled as to conclude for a truth, that there was no looking for our lord Ieſus in the ſepulchre. We ſée then from whence this feare came. And hereby wee may perceiue that this is a ſinful affection. Indéede, wee muſt (as I haue ſaide) feare GOD, reuerence his maieſtie, obey him, and wholy be humbled, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end he might be gloriouſly exalted, and all mouthes be ſtopped, &amp; he therby be known, to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only iuſt, wiſe, &amp; omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t god. But this feare wherof mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is made in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 2. place is wicked &amp; da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nable: for it turned to the ſhame of theſe ſéely wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, bicauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> although they both ſée &amp; heard the Angel ſpeake, yet they thought it to be but a dreame as it were. Now, by this we are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> god ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times ſo worketh in vs, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we do not perceue, as a man would ſay, whether we haue profited any whit or not: for we ar ſo ignorant &amp; ſo fantaſtical, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are ouerſhadowed as w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> clouds, wherby we are not able to behold the clere light, to be ſhort, all the doctrine of God ſéemeth to vs very vnprofitable: &amp; yet wée find ſome taſt amongſt, which maketh vs féele y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god hath wrought in our harts. For although ther be but a ſpark of grace in vs, let vs not be diſcouraged: but beſéeche the Lord to encreaſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> litle that he hath begun, vntil ſuch time as we be brought to a ful perfection, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the which we are as yet very far of.</p>
            <pb n="89" facs="tcp:7663:95"/>
            <p>And although the feare and ioy which theſe women had, be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and condemned for a falt, yet we ſée that God continually go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned them by his holy ſpirit, and that the meſſage which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel deliuered vnto them, was not altogether vnprofitable. We are now to looke farder into the matter: and that is this, that Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus appeared in the way vnto them, and ſaid, <hi>feare ye not but goe and tell my Brethren, that they meete altogether in Galile, and there they ſhall ſee mee.</hi> We ſee héere in this place, a great deale more, how that the ſonne of God draweth vs vnto him by degrées, vntill ſuch time as we be throughly confirmed, whereof wee haue great néede. Now, this was ſufficient enough that the women had hard the meſſage deliuered by the mouth of the Angel, &amp; the ſignes and tokens wer ſuch as that they could not chuſe but think that he was ſent from God, for his face did ſhine, as it were. In very déede, the whit garment and ſuch like, was not, liuely to expreſſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie of God, howbeit the women had an aſſured teſtimony that it was not a mortall man which ſpake, but an Angell from heauen. And therfore, this was a ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t teſtimony vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but yet they were a great deale the more aſſured, whenas they had ſéene our Lord Ieſus, whom they before knew to be the ſonne of God, &amp; his vnchaungable truth. And this more fully ratified the thing, which they had before heard by the mouth of the Angel. And thus wee ſée how we may encreaſe in faith: for at the firſt, we ſhal not be able to vnderſtand, what power and effect is in the worde of God, but if we be taught well, ſomthing we learne by it, and yet is this litle or nothing God wat: howbeit, God by litle and litle toucheth vs w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his holy ſpirit, &amp; in the end ſheweth vs that it is he himſelfe which ſpeaketh. And then are we fully reſolued, inſomuch as we haue not only ſome knowledge, but we are alſo ſo perſwaded, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when the deuill ſhall go about to deuiſe whatſoeuer he can poſſibly, yet ſhall he neuer be able to ſhake our faith, becauſe we hold this principle, that the ſonne of God is our teacher, vpon whom we ſtay, becauſe we know him to haue all maſterſhip ouer vs, &amp; is worthy of moſt excellent authority. And this we ſée was in theſe women. Indéede, God worketh not alike, in al men. For God wil ſo cal ſome, euen at the firſt, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhall perceue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath powred vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful extraordinary power, &amp; yet we ſhal be oftentimes ſo taught, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may plainly ſée our groſſenes and weaknes, to the end we
<pb facs="tcp:7663:96"/> might therby ſo much the more gloryfy our God, &amp; acknowledge, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whatſoeuer we haue, commeth al from him Let vs now come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaying, which hath bene already ſpoken of, <hi>Go &amp; tel my Brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they meete all together in Galile.</hi> We ſee then héere, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſon of God appeared not to Mary, and to the company which were w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her only, as to ſhow himſelf to ſeuen or eight perſons, but his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this meſſage ſhould be publiſhed vnto the Apoſtles, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> it ſhould be at this preſent deliuered vnto vs, that we might be par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>takers therof. And to ſay the truth, if it were not ſo, what ſhoulde the ſtory of the reſurrection availe vs? but when it is ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Son of God was ſo manifeſted, &amp; would haue the benefit therof to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated vnto al the world, we may now the better taſt of it. So then, let vs vnderſtand, that our Lord Ieſus his meaning was, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhould be certified of his reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, bicauſe that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we know in truth, that our Lord Ieſus is riſen againe, that therin conſiſteth all the hope of our ſaluation, &amp; rightuouſneſſe. Not that he hath not cleanſed al our filthines by his death &amp; paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but becauſe it ſhould not remaine &amp; continue ſtil weak. And therfore, it behoued that hée ſhould poure abrod the vertu of his holy ſpirit, that he might by his reſurrection,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4.</note> be declared to bee the ſonne of God: as S. Paul in the Epiſtle to the Romaines, and in diuers other places, ſufficiently declareth.</p>
            <p>Thus now we ſée, that we muſt aſſure our ſelues, that our Lord Ieſus is ryſen againe, &amp; leaueth the way open vnto vs, that wee might come vnto him: &amp; looketh not that we ſhould ſéeke him, but hath prouided that we might be called by the preching of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel, &amp; that his meſſage ſhould ſound in the mouthes of thoſe his heralts whom he had choſen. Since then it is ſo, let vs vnderſtand, that the rightuouſnes whiche wee at that this daye haue for the attaining vnto the heauenly Kingdome, wee enioy by the righteouſneſſe of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe he will not ſeperat him ſelfe from vs. And héere we ſée why he calleth the Diſciples his brethren. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déede, this is an honorable name: and was reſerued for all thoſe whom he accompted as his houſhold Seruants: and this kinde of ſpeche no doubt he vſed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.17.</note> to ſhew the brotherhood that hee would, ſhould betwéene him and them. And ſo alſo is it common to vs, as Saint Iohn more plainly declareth.</p>
            <pb n="90" facs="tcp:7663:96"/>
            <p>Now, to ſay truly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.23.</note> we muſt haue recourſe vnto that ſaying of the Pſalm, out of which this place is taken: I will declare thy name vnto my Brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which place the Apoſtle in the expoſition of the perſon of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, did not only comprehend the 12.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>hebr.</hi> 2.11.</note> Apoſtles by the name of the Brethren of Ieſus Chriſt, but geueth alſo the ſame title generally to as many as follow the ſonne of god and would haue vs to enioy the ſelfe ſame honor. We ſée alſo why our Lorde Ieſus ſaide, I goe vnto my God, and to your God, vnto my father, and vnto your father: now this was not ment by a few but it was ſpoken to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> multitude of all the faithfull. And although our Lord Ieſus Chriſt bee our eternall God, yet is hee contented notwithſtanding euen in the perſon of a mediator, to abaſe himſelf and come néere vs, and to haue all thinges common with vs, in reſpect of his humaine nature. For although hee, bee the naturall Sonne of God, and we by adoption, and grace, yet this community remayneth, that the Father of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, is by his meane ours alſo, in diuers reſpectes. For it is not méete that wée ſhould be exalted as hie as our head and ſoueraine: and ſurely this could not but be a wonderfull confuſion, if the head of a mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye ſhould not be aboue all the reſt of the members, for otherwiſe it would ſéeme a very monſter, and a confuſed lump: and therefore it is alſo very good reaſon, that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſhould kéepe his chiefe degrée, becauſe he is by nature the only ſonne of God: and yet this letteth not but that we may be ioyned with him in Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood, that we might fréely and with good aſſueraunce call vpon God, and bee hearde, becauſe we haue familiar acceſſe vnto him. We ſée then what the meaning of this ſaying is, when our Lorde Ieſus calleth his Diſciples, Brethren: to wit, he dyd it to this end, that we at this day ſhould haue the like priuiledge with them, by the meane of faith. And yet this is nothing derogatorye from the power and maieſtie of the Sonne of God, when he thus conioyneth himſelf with ſuch wretched creatures as we are, and be as it were one of our company. Wherfore we ought to bee ſo much the more in an admiration, with the matter, whenas we ſée him vſe ſuch his goodnes towards vs: as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by his reſurrection hée hath purchaſed for vs y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauenly glory, for the purchaſing wherof he abaſed himſelf, &amp; became of no reputation. Since it is ſo, that our Lord Ieſus vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaueth to allow vs for his Brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to the end we might come vnto
<pb facs="tcp:7663:97"/> God, let vs boldly ſéeke him, and come vnto him, whiles hée thus gently inuileth vs: neither doth he maruellous co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderately, vſe his word only to draw vs, but addeth withal a viſible ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t alſo, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> we might be brought thereto according to our ſmal ability. And to ſay y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, let it be, that we be neuer ſo weak &amp; blockiſhe, yet ſhall we not be able to excuſe our ſlacknes, if we come not vnto our lord Ieſus Chriſt: behold y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> table wherunto he hath called vs: &amp; to what end? forſooth it is not to the end to fil our bellies: although that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, God declareth himſelf to haue a fatherly care ouer vs, and our Lorde Ieſus alſo ſheweth, that he himſelfe is indéede the life of the world. Wherefore, when wée daily eate and drinke, it witneſſeth thus much vnto vs, that our Lord Ieſus declareth his goodnes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs: But in this table, there is a ſpecial co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration to be had: for it ſheweth vs that we are the brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: to wit,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.21.</note> that becauſe (as S. Iohn ſaith) he hath vnited vs vnto himſelf, he hath alſo vnited vs vnto God his father, &amp; ſo by little &amp; little tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs, that he is our meat, &amp; our drinke: &amp; we are take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be of his own ſubſtaunce, that wee might haue al our ſpirituall life in him. And this is more then if hée called vs his brethren an hundered times.</p>
            <p>Let vs therfore vnderſtand and know the vnitie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wee haue with our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: to wit, that he will haue his life to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with vs, and his lyfe, to be our life: yea that he wil effectually dwell in vs, and not by imagination: and after an earthly maner, but after a ſpiritual: &amp; how euer it is, he ſo worketh in vs by his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit, as that we are knit faſter &amp; ſuerer vnto him, then the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to the body. And as the roote of a trée thruſteth out his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce and ſtrength into all the braunches, euen ſo receiue we our ſubſtaunce &amp; life from our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7.</note> And this alſo is the cauſe why Saint Paul ſaieth, that our paſchall Lamb was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and offered vp: and that we ſhould now kéepe holyday, and bée partakers of the ſacrifice. And as in the old law, when any ſacrifice was offered, they did eat and were mery, euen ſo likewiſe muſt we now come and receiue our ſpirituall meat and foode, which is héere offered vnto vs in this ſacrifice, for our redemption. In veridéed wee muſt not eate Ieſus Chriſt fleſhly, for he is not betwéene our téethes, as the Papiſtes doo dreame: But wee take Breade, for a ſure &amp; vndoubted pawne, that we féede on the body of Ieſus Chriſt
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7663:97"/> ſpiritually: and we receiue a litle wine, to ſhew that we are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſuſtained by his precious blood. Howbeit let vs with all note, the ſaying of Saint Paul, that becauſe vnder the figures of the lawe, it was not lawfull to eate leauened bread, and that wee are now no more vnder ſuch ſhadowes, wee muſt caſt away the leauen of maliciouſneſſe, and wickedneſſe, and of all our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and take to vs the bread which hath no bitterneſſe but the bread of pureneſſe, and truth. And therefore, when we come vnto this holy Table, wherein the ſonne of God ſheweth vs, that he is our meat, and giueth him ſelfe vnto vs for a full and whole repaſt, and would haue vs be now partakers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacrifice which he once offered for our ſaluation, we ought to looke well vnto it, that wee come not hether ſpotted and filed with ſinne and iniquity, but vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to forſake them all and be altogether cleanſed of them, to the ende our Lorde Ieſus might allow vs to bee the members of his body, and by that meanes alſo be partakers of his life. And thus we ſée how we muſt profyt our ſelues at this day by this holy ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which is made ready for vs: which is this, that it may lead vs vnto the death and paſſion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and alſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his reſurrection: that therby we may truſt to haue life &amp; ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe that by his victorious reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we are made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the gates of heauen in ſuch ſort ſet open vnto vs, as that we may bouldly approche vnto our God, and offer our ſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, ſince wee knowe that hee wyll alwayes take vs as his children.</p>
            <p>Let vs now fall downe before the maieſtie of our good God, &amp; acknowledge our offences, beſéechinge him to haue mercy vpon vs, that we may finde fauour at his handes, although we deſerue it not. And that he will not pardon onely the ſinnes whiche wee haue already committed, but alſo ridde vs of all the faultes and miſeries of our fleſh, vntill ſuch time as hee hath clothed vs with the perfection of his holyneſſe, wherevnto hee dalye exhorteth vs. And ſo, let vs all ſay: O almighty God and heauenly Father. &amp;c.</p>

Now it is long time paſt ſithence the redéemer was promiſed: But when it was thoughte that the ligne of Dauid was vtterly extinguiſhed, the hope of the faithfull might altogether haue bin aboliſhed. For it was ſaid y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God would eſtabliſh a king for euer,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Kin.</hi> 24.15 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 36.10</note> &amp; would ſet him on Dauids ſeate, &amp; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that he ſhould haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſunne and the moone of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet ſhould this kingdom be mainteined &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſerued: &amp; that although al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world ſhould periſh, yet ſhould this be ſo ſtable &amp; ſure, as that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7663:98"/> it ſhould very wel be ſéen, that this was a kingdom wholly conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated vnto God. And yet for al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, it decreaſed: yea, &amp; ſoone after by little &amp; little fell in decay, vntil ſuch time as the laſt king ſaue one,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Kin.</hi> 15.7. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 39.6.<hi>32.</hi>9.</note> was carried away captiue, &amp; al the kingly ligne tranſlated, &amp; as it were cleane cut of. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laſt king, who was created at the charge of an Infidel, &amp; an enemie vnto al religion, in the ende playing the rebell, againſt him, it ſo fell out as that the king was take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, his eyes put out, he was indited, his children were ſlaine, he himſelfe was moſt ſhamefully condemned: &amp; the temple, with al his houſes were burnt. What was to be thought héervpon? Forſooth, it muſt néeds bée, that the Iewes aſſured themſelues by the Prophet, that God would in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end, take compaſſion on them, and bring them out of captiuitie: For it was méete he ſhoulde tel them, that, that which was ſpoken to Abraham in the old time was not ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in vayne, That in his ſéede, all the nations of the earth ſhoulde bee bleſſed: and that there ſhould be a king of the ligne of Dauid eſtabliſhed, whoſe Empire ſhould be euerlaſting and without end.</p>
               <p>And therefore we ſée, why Iſaiah reſtraineth heere his ſpéeche vnto the perſon of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: to this end &amp; purpoſe (I ſay) that the rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption &amp; returne of the people, which before hée had ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, might be holden to be moſt certayne and ſure. Nowe we haue ſéene here aboue,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 42.1.</note> that our Lord Ieſus was called <hi>The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt of God,</hi> forſomuch as he moſt obediently ſubmitted himſelf for our ſaluation: yea, beyng hée, who was Lord of glory, the head of the Angels, and before whom euery knée muſt bowe. Wherfore, ſince this name of ſeruaunt is geuen vnto him, let vs vnderſtande that it is, becauſe he tooke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him our nature, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hée would not only abaſe himſelfe therein, but alſo be made of no reputation. For it coulde not bée choſen but that our tranſgreſſions and iniquities, muſt be repayred through his obedience. And according to that, which hée ſaide to Iohn Baptiſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> hée muſt néedes fulfil the meaſure of al righteouſneſſe: Thus wée ſée, that although our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was ful of al maieſty, &amp; God euerlaſting, yet becauſe he took vpon him our nature, and became like vnto vs hée thought not ſkorne too bée of the loweſt degree of men whiche cannot bee gaineſayd. For although his diuine nature was no whit chaunged
<pb facs="tcp:7663:99"/> Yet if we conſider well of the matter, it was méete he ſhould abaſe himſelfe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.4.</note> as he was a Mediator betwixt God and vs: for it is ſaid, that he was made ſubiect to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, although indéed he was no whit indebted to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, for it was he that muſt rule all, and vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al ſubiection was due: howebeit he placed himſelfe in that ranke that he might frée vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the yoke which we were not able to beare. For the law was a burden to preſſe vs cleane downe, if ſo be our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt had not borne it, and had fréede vs thereof by that meane. Neither let vs thinke it ſtraunge that hée was called the ſeruant of God: ſéeing hée refuſed not eftſoones to become our ſeruant, which was very much. For if wée conſider of our owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, wée ſée it is but a vayne thing, wée are but ſillie woormes of the earth, and the Deuill, and ſinne haue power ouer vs: and yet behold how the only ſonne of God hath abaſed himſelfe to become our ſeruant,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8</note> according to the ſaying of Saint Paule. For hée is (I ſay) the Miniſter of Circumciſion.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the Prophet namely vſeth the ſelfe ſame woordes, to the ende wee might vnderſtand, that whatſoeuer is héere ſpoken of him, is for the common benefite &amp; welfare of the whole church. Nowe, we muſt conſider whervnto it was, that Ieſus Chriſt was called: to wit, to be the Redéemer of al the faithful and choſen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. And therefore, ſince this charge was committed vnto him, and that he was ſo called, let vs not ſtande in doubt, but that whatſoeuer is ſaide of his perſon, is common to vs, and that the benefite thereof ſhall redound vnto vs, which héereafter we ſhal ſée. And thus much of the meaning of the Prophet. Now it is ſaid, that Ieſus Chriſt being called: which was to an office to ſaue thoſe that are his, <hi>ſhoulde flooriſhe, and bee woonderfully exalted and magnified,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was ſpoken to this ende, that all the faithfull might bée armed againſt the temptation wherwith they might be atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted before Ieſus Chriſt ſhuld appeare in glory and maieſty, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſay before that he, who was God eternal, and ful of glory, were mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in the fleſhe. For when the Iewes were tranſlated into Babylon (as hath béene before ſaide) then was the dignitie of Dauid his ligne cleane ſcraped out and defaced. Howbeit this is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:7663:99"/> true in déed, that after the returne of a few of them, there was one Zorobabell who was taken for a Captein and chief: But he ware no Kingly Diadeame or Crowne, hée had but a certaine title of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour giuen him: becauſe the people beare alwayes a reuerence vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the houſe of Dauid. Thus we ſée (I ſay) that Zorobabell was obeyed: yea forſooth, but yet there was no ſhew of gouernment in him. And therefore it was méet that the faithfull ſhould be armed againſt ſuch a temptation, &amp; that God ſhould aſſure them that the Redéemer ſhould come, and notwithſtanding that the earth and all bottomleſſe depthes ſhould open to giue him place to come out, and that hée might be aduanced aloft, yet for all that, muſt this thing néedes come to paſſe. And ſo, it is not to be doubted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Prophet maketh here a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon betwéen two contrary things: that is, that Ieſus Chriſt muſt be as it were lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g time hid, yea, &amp; as one plunged ouer head &amp; eares in the bottomles depths: &amp; beſides, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhuld come, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould not come in ſuch great glory &amp; pompous ſhewe, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men ſhould make any great eſtimation of him: But contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould be naught ſet by, or els ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temptible, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a man would think, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſaluation of the people, ſhould neuer be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhed, and brought about, by his meane: &amp; yet ſhould he be exalted. But it is a great deale more plainly expreſſed, when as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>That he was more disfigured then any man, &amp; no forme nor faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to beſeene in him,</hi> as if he were not worthy to come into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men, but to be taken to be a moſt deteſtable fellow, &amp; the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry countenance of him, only to be abhorred. Thus we ſée y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pretenſe of the Prophet, in ſaying that Ieſus Chriſt was exalted. Héere are then two things, which ſhould ſéeme at the firſt ſight, to be nothing like, nor poſſible to be reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled: to wit, that Ieſus Chriſt was not to be knowne: to be ſought for, and not found: &amp; when he ſhould bée ſéene, no account to be made of him: laſt of all: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there was nothing to be found in him worthy of reputation, &amp; yet that God woulde ſo lift him vp, magnifie, &amp; exalt him, as that hée ſhould ſurpaſſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we might any way co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue of his maieſty, here in this world. A man might ſay, that theſe two things could no more agrée toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fire &amp; water: &amp; yet the Prophet ſaith, that we muſt beléeue that God wil in ſuch ſort work, as that baſe beginnings ſhal be no let to bring things to a perfect end. Mark alſo why it is ſaid, that he ſhal be wonderfully lifted vp, exalted, &amp; aduanced: For, this was a
<pb facs="tcp:7663:100"/> temptation hardly to be withſtood &amp; ouercome. Neither is it alſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that God declareth vnto vs in a word, what he meaneth to doe, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſée how his doings are withſtood, &amp; that it ſéemeth, that, that, which God hath ſaid, is impoſſible to be brought to paſſe, yet let vs be confirmed &amp; ſtrengthened, and be able to haue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to ouercome whatſoeuer may be laid before vs, to hinder our beléeuing the promiſes of God. And therfore, this is euen as much as if the Prophet had ſaid, My friends, aſſure your ſelues that God will exalt the Redéemer, yea, he will doe it in déede. But if we will reply &amp; ſay, you ſay wel ſir, but I pray you which way? For we ſée, that the meanes are too too ſtrange. Well haue you no doubt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: becauſe the power of God is of ſo great might as you are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to vnderſtand it: But (howeuer it is) if you doubt, &amp; wauer, and fall to reaſoning, &amp; wil not be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented with theſe words, withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d I ſay, theſe fond imaginations, &amp; be ſtrong, ſet your ſelues agaynſt your vnbeliefe: &amp; be of this reſolute minde, that howeuer it is, God will worke farre beyond your expectation, &amp; farre beyond your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and reaſon. Thus we ſée the pretenſe of the Prophet by vſing theſe thrée, or rather foure kindes of ſayinges, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding do ſignifie all one thing. And he declareth it very wel to be ſo, by ſaying, <hi>That he was foule and yll fauoured,</hi> and not worthie to be looked on, becauſe there was neither beautie nor good counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in him, but was as one cut off from the company of all men, and not worthy to be placed amongſt mortal men. Now, this, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time ſerueth, ſhal be more amply declared: For this very ſentence ſhal be again rehearſed, for a more large ſetting forth of the matter. But howeuer it is, the prophet hath alredy declared, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes, in looking for their Redéemer, muſt cloſe vp their eyes againſt all ſuch things as they haue bin wonted to ſéeke after, &amp; giue place vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to faith, &amp; ſo be aſſured of the goodnes of God, although all were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their opinion. And this is not onely ſpoken of the perſon of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, but alſo of the whole courſe of his Goſpell, and of the whole order which he taketh for the maintenance &amp; go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the faithfull. And therefore if we would be aſſured of our ſaluation in Ieſus Chriſt, we muſt in the firſt place, not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that he was ſo diſfigured after the maner of men, &amp; being ſent into the world, was taken to be as one moſt accurſed: and ſoone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, his Goſpel was in ſuch ſort ſlaundered as we ſée it to be euen at
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7663:100"/> this day. For if we be aſhamed to receiue our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt crucified, without doubt we are excluded from all hope of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For, how are we ſaued by him? How belongeth the heauenly enhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance to vs, without he had béen made accurſed for vs, &amp; not only accurſed before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but alſo by the mouth of God his father? Thus we ſée, that Ieſus Chriſt, the fountaine of all bleſſing, hath neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles borne our ſinnes, and was made like vnto the old ſacrifices which were called ſin offrings,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> becauſe the wrath of God was ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; men were freed &amp; pardoned by them. And howe could Ieſus Chriſt be called our life, if he had not ſwallowed vp death by his death? Either how could we be exalted by him, but becauſe hée went down into the bottom of hell, to wit, he ſuſteined the horrors that were vpon vs, and wherwith, by reaſon of our ſinne, we were held vnder? For it muſt néedes be that God muſt be our Iudge for euer: &amp; this is the moſt fearfull thing that may be, to haue God our enemy. And it behoued y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ieſus Chriſt ſhould enter into it, as our pledge, &amp; as one that ſhould make ſatiſfaction for vs, and ſuſtayne our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we therby might be pardoned. And therefore, let vs thinke it no ſtrange thing to ſée him thus diſfigured: &amp; if this in our reaſon, be fooliſhneſſe, let vs vnderſtand (as S. Paul ſaith) that the fooliſhneſſe of God ſurpaſſeth all the wiſdom of the world. Hée calleth that, the fooliſhneſſe of God, in that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt was ſo abaſed, &amp; ſurely, if we wold here ſet down our iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we would ſay without doubt, that it were an abſurde thing. For, to what purpoſe could it be any way poſſible that hée, who was to be worſhipped both in heauen and in earth, ſhoulde be ſo ſhamefully dealt withall? Thus we ſée howe that we in our arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie, &amp; preſumption, will, as raſhly and boldly as may be, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually condemne, whatſoeuer God doth for our redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit God in his ſecret counſell ſheweth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath more wit, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we, any way are able to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue of. And therfore, let vs in the firſt place hold this for a ſure ground, that ſéeing our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was not only co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temptible, &amp; abaſed, but alſo made of no reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for our ſakes, not to forget (as S. Paul ſaith) to giue him the honour, belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vnto him: for, his glory was no whit empaired therby, althogh al men knew it not: yet did his gratious goodnes ſhine ſo much the more clearly. And beſides we ought to tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>as we ſée y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of God, refuſed not to be as it wer diſfigured, being y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very image of
<pb facs="tcp:7663:101"/> God his father:<note place="margin">Hebr. <hi>1.</hi>3.</note> For, all this he did, becauſe hée would repaire this image in vs. And this is certaine, we are ſo ſpotted, as that when we ſhal appeare before the maieſtie of God, it cannot be choſen but that he muſt reiect vs, vntill ſuch time as our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt hath ſet his brand vpon vs, whereby we might become acceptable vnto God, and finde fauour at his hands. So, when we heare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hée was vgly, &amp; yll fauoured, let vs looke well to our ſelues, &amp; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that hée, muſt take vnto himſelf, all our ſpots &amp; blots, to the end we might be clenſed of them, bringing now with vs before the iudgement ſeate of God, nothing but righteouſnes &amp; holines, which we could neuer haue had, except God had communicated the ſame vnto vs in Ieſus Chriſt. And herevpon he ſaith, <hi>That the mouthes of Kings ſhal be ſtopped, when as he ſhal haue beene thus exalted,</hi> and that they ſhoulde ſée ſuche a chaunge as neuer was thought of. Here then, we are told, that we muſt not raſhly iudge, when as we ſée our lord Ieſus Chriſt to be thus abaſed, &amp; naught ſet by, but we muſt conſider to what end the Lord hath ſo brought him: which is, that ſuch an excellent name was giuen him aboue all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery knée ſhould bow before him, as it is ſaid in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to the Philippians.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phili.</hi> 2.9.</note> For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> S.

Who (ſaith hée) being the true God, thought it no robbery to be equal w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God, &amp; made him ſelfe of no reputation, taking vpon him the forme of a ſeruant: yea &amp; became obedient euen vnto that moſt ſlaunderous and curſed death, the death of the croſſe, and that, before God and men: and all this hée did, to the ende hée woulde take vpon him whatſoeuer was dewe to vs.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, ſaieth hée, God the Father hath exalted him, and giuen him ſuch a name, as that euerie knée ſhould bowe, of things in earth, and thinges vnder the earth, &amp; that euerie tongue ſhoulde confeſſe that the Lord is Ieſus Chriſt, to the glory of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and that if we would ſée what the maieſtie of God is, &amp; glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him as hée is worthie, we muſt néedes come vnto our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. And this is in effect the meaning of the Prophet, That we muſt not for the baſenes of Ieſus Chriſt for a time, but beléeue in him, and ſet our whole heart on him: and alſo conſider to what end he was thus handled: and that whenſoeuer we ſpeake of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7663:101"/> his death, we muſt foorthwith remember his reſurrection, &amp; ioyne them both together: For theſe are two inſeperable thinges, That Ieſus Chriſt would ſuffer in the weaknes of our fleſh, and ryſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in the power of his ſpirit: and that in this laſt point,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>2. Cor.</hi> 13.<hi>4. Rom.</hi> 1.4.</note> (as S. Paul ſaith) he ſhewed himſelf to be the true ſonne of God. And we ſée alſo beſides, the pretence of the Prophet in this place. We haue before ſaide, that this was not onely ſéene in the perſon of Ieſus Chriſt, but alſo in his Goſpel. For, how was Ieſus Chriſt known? and what obedience did the world yéeld him, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Goſpell was preached? We ſée, that they vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the greateſt authoritie was giuen, did not only ſcorne &amp; condemne men, but alſo beat them, and ſcourged them, and in the ende put them to moſt ſhamefull death. And therfore, ſince it is ſo, Let vs ouercome all ſuch offences, and being armed, as the Prophet héere ſpeaketh of, Let vs conſider to what ende it was, that our Lord Ieſus came to ſtop the mouthes, that is to ſay, to make men aſtonied, that they ſhoulde not be able to reply, as we ſée the Ganderlike gagling and iangling Infidelles and faithleſſe doe. Now, it is true, that there is ſuch dealing, and they cannot come to honour our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe (as they thinke) they haue ſome reaſon, to ſay to the contrary. Howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, we are héere told, that if wée did conſider, wherfore it was, that our Lorde Ieſus came, and what the ende, and fruite, of his death and paſſion which hée ſuffered for vs, was, that then our mouthes ſhoulde bée ſtopped. For, when the Scripture ſpeaketh after this ſort, it bringeth vs to a conſideration of the ſure eſtabliſhed, and ſetled woorkes of God. For, ſo long as our mouthes are open, (as I haue alreadie ſaide) wée will enter into the cauſe, and ſo reaſon, as that God ſhall bee ſhut cleane out of the doores, and whatſoeuer hée hath done, ſhall be naught ſet by. But when it is ſaide, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie mouth ſhall holde it peace, and be ſilent before the Lorde, this ſheweth that all our reaſons ſhould bée daunted and empriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, yea euen to bridle our tongues, that we might quietly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe, that God is to be glorified in the perſon of his onely Sonne. And if this be ſaide of Princes, what ſhall the common people doe? Wée are therefore, throughly to conſider of the order which the Prophet héere ſetteth downe: For hée giueth vs this animaduerſion or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt muſt be as it were vgly and yll fauoured, and be refuſed of the worlde. Wherefore, ſince the holy
<pb facs="tcp:7663:102"/> Ghoſt thus warneth vs, Let vs not thinke it ſtraunge, nor yet bée careleſſe to embraſe him with a liuely faith: &amp; although his Croſſe (which is a deteſtable Gallow trée in the ſight of men) might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw vs, and altogether eſtraunge vs from him, yet let not vs bée ſlacke in ſéeking after our whole glorie, to wit, in Ieſus Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. Moreouer, let vs not ſtay our ſelues vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſuffring, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we might conceiue a great ſhame in him, whervnto he willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmitted himſelfe for vs: But let vs ioyne his reſurrection and his death together, and vnderſtand that although he was crucified, yet that hée ſitteth as Lieftenant to God his Father, exerciſing the moſt excellent gouernment, hauing all power giuen him aſwell in heauen, as in earth. And here we ſée, why it is ſaid that he ſhall bée exalted. In verie déed, that he was lifted vp &amp; exalted vnto the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, was in the ſight of men a ſhamefull thing: howbeit he moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and beguiled the Deuil, &amp; ſet himſelf againſt all the world, in ſaying that hée ſhould be liuely exalted: and when he was put to this ſhame, that euery mans tongue walked, &amp; vomited out their blaſphemies &amp; villainies againſt him, yet ſitteth hée in his throne, as we haue alredie declared out of the place of S. Paule.<note place="margin">Coloſ. 2.<hi>15.</hi>
                  </note> And in an other place, hée namely ſaieth, that the Croſſe, although it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time a Gallowes full of ſhame, was now as it were a Chary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot of tryumph: and that Ieſus Chriſt hath not only ouercome the Deuill therein, but alſo hath ſhewed that we might nowe glorifie our ſelues, forſomuch as we are freed from all condemnation: that ſinne hath no more power ouer vs, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al the deuils in hel are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together cut off, from all kinde of pretenſe whatſoeuer againſt vs. We ſée then in ſumme, that we muſt aſcend vp by fayth vnto the glory of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to the ende we might not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſéeke for our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his Croſſe, our bleſſing in his curſe, our life, in his death, our glory in his ſhame, and our ioy in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes, out of which came water and blood. And this is the ſumme which we haue to conſider of in this place.<note place="margin">Luk. <hi>22.</hi>44.</note> Nowe, the Prophet namely ſaith, <hi>That he will bedeaw, or ſprinkle.</hi> In very déede, this ſaying, by a ſimilitude, ſignifieth alſo to ſpeake fayre: But when we ſhall conſider better of the matter, we ſhall finde, that the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall meaning of the Prophet in theſe wordes, That Ieſus Chriſt ſhall bedeaw all nations is this: to wit, that although hée be a dry and fruitleſſe blocke, yet ſhall all the worlde be bedeawed through
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7663:102"/> his power and vertue. To be ſhort, he ſheweth that God wil work after an incomprehenſible maner, and that the Iewes ſhould not looke for any worldly helpe, but beleeue that God will ſurpaſſe all mens thoughtes and imaginations. For, when we are told of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, our ſences muſt needes fayle vs: and when we are tolde of miſteries, that is to ſay, ſecrets, we muſt vnderſtand, that we are not ſufficient Iudges nor Arbiters, or dayes men, to ſay, it muſt néedes be ſo: But let vs worſhip the thing that cannot ſinke into our brayne, nor which we cannot finde out the reaſon of. And thus much we haue in ſumme to conſider of. Now, this admonition ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteineth to vs: for, as I haue alredie ſaide, we ſhould abide to be bedewed with our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: and although he hath appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be as one that were fruitleſſe, and that there can be nothing found in him, worthy reputation, yet, when hée ſhall offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf vnto vs, and come néere vs, let vs not thruſt him back through miſbeliefe, but rather giue him frée acceſſe through fayth And this is in ſumme, the thing which we are to learne out of this doctrine of the Prophet. Moreouer, hée ſaieth, that all the world ſhall be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deawed with our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to wit, by the preaching of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For, they</hi> (ſaieth hée) <hi>who neuer heard any ſpeech of him, ſhall heare of him: and they which neuer vnderſtood, ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Héere, the Prophet amplifieth his purpoſe, ſhewing that God the Father would ſend our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, not onely to bée a Sauiour vnto the Iewes (although hée was liuely promiſed vnto them) but alſo vnto the whole world. Now, to proue the meaning of the Prophet to be thus,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.21</note> S. Paul himſelf ſaith as much in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the Romans, applying this ſaying vnto his, being ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſtraunge countries, hauing trauelled here and there, filling all nations with the Goſpell, &amp; in ſuch places as God was neuer ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, preaching not only vnto the Iewes, but alſo vnto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſée the drift of the Prophete: and this place ought to bée as a keye, to open vnto vs the kingdome God. For if Ieſus Chriſt had not béene promiſed but onely to the ligne of Abraham, what had wée béene the better for him? For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hée was a Sauiour and Redéemer, yet is this nothing
<pb facs="tcp:7663:103"/> to vs, we haue neither part nor portion herein. But becauſe it was tolde of ſo long time, before hée was ſent, that hée ſhould bedeaw all people: Forſooth, becauſe that they which neuer before vnderſtood, might vnderſtand: and that they to whom it was neuer before told, might heare: Let vs vnderſtande, that our God had adopted vs, when as Ieſus Chriſt came into the worlde, and that hée accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed whatſoeuer was requiſite and neceſſarie for our ſaluation: inſomuch that the Goſpell is nowe as a rayne to giue vs heauenly ſtrength, by reaſon we are altogether fruitleſſe, and becauſe wée are hunger ſteruen, and voide of the grace of God, we muſt bee ſtrengthened by the doctrine of the Goſpell, that wée might féele what the death of our Redéemer is woorth, and what it auayleth vs, and that his life is the perfection of our ioy. Now, it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the Prophet would neuer haue ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here of the Iewes, had they not bin brought vp &amp; acquainted with the law: but would haue included the ſtrange nations, who before had béen brought vp in all ſuperſtition and idolatry. For all the world cut off the God of Iſrael, &amp; had him in contempt, and the Gentiles, made a ſcorne at the true religion. Now, it is ſaid that they ſhould heare, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing heard,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17.</note> ſhould alſo vnderſtand. By theſe wordes, the Prophet ſheweth, from whence fayth commeth, to wit, by hearing of the worde of God: But by the way, hée alſo meaneth that it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to haue our eares beaten with the hearing of the Goſpell, without wée vnderſtande it. Nowe, this is not giuen to all men: and therfore this ſaying muſt be reſtrayned vnto Gods choſen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to ſuche as are renued by the holie Ghoſt: as alſo it is more liuely declared when as he ſaith, <hi>Who will beleeue our prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching? and to whom ſhall the arme of the Lord be reuealed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Héere the Prophet pauſeth in the middeſt of his wordes, and cryeth out as one that were merueylouſly aſtonied. And this place, is greatly woorth the noting. Wée haue heard, that hée exhorteth the faythfull to magnanimitie and conſtancy, as if hée had ſayde, My good friendes, be not abaſhed although your Redéemer bee of no eſtimation nor credite, in the worlde, but is rather ſpetted vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, deſpighted, and alſo accurſed and banned: yet let not vs for all this loath him, becauſe God hath ſo ordeined it. But in the end you ſhall ſée, that when hée aroſe againe out of the bottomleſſe depth of death, hée was ſo highly exalted, as that he had al power giuen him
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7663:103"/> both in heauen and in earth. And therefore, ſticke not to worſhip this Redéemer, who hath ſo abaſed himſelfe for your benefite.</p>
               <p>Now in very déede, he compareth him to rayne, and ſayth that God ſhall bedeaw or ſprinckle thoſe which neuer vnderſtood the trueth, but were as a man woulde ſay like vnto bruite beaſtes. They, ſayth hée, ſhall be taught, and be made partakers of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite which was purchaſed, and the Church of God ſhalbe ſo ſpred ouer the face of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole earth, as that they which haue blaſpemed this ſincere doctrine, ſhall haue their mouthes ſtopped, except they will moſte reuerently and ſoberly confeſſe, that there is none but the GOD of Iſraell that is to bée honoured, and that his onely Sonne, the very liuely Image of his glory and Maieſtie, ought to bee receiued and worſhipped. Yea kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues although they be neuer ſo proudly bente, ſhalbe enforced to abaſe themſelues, and moſt willingly obey. Thus wee ſée howe honourable the wordes of the Prophet are.</p>
               <p>Nowe, hée foreſéeth that when the Goſpell ſhall bee preached throughout the face of the whole earth, that ſome will make a ieſt at it, ſome will bee madde at it, ſome wyll neuer finde any taſte in it, ſome will be blockiſhe, other ſome will hypocritically lye vnto GOD, and make a ſhewe that they loue and obey the Goſpell, and yet all ſhall bee but plaine diſſembling. Wherefore, the Prophet ſéeing the worlde to bee thus wicked, and foreſéeing that God ſhoulde not bee hearde, nor yet his worde ſo reuerently recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as it ought, wondered, and cryed out ſaying, <hi>Who ſhal beleeue our doctrine?</hi> As if hee ſhoulde haue ſaide, Alas, I preache héere ſaluation vnto the worlde, but it is all loſte labour without this remedie bée had: to wit, that GOD will ſende his onely ſonne, to fight againſt the Diuell and death, that hée myght thereby purchaſe vs righteouſneſſe, and life: For this doctrine is it that muſt bedeawe all the worlde ouer, otherwiſe wee are very fruitleſſe. There is in vs nothing but drynes and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedneſſe: and yet God tarrieth not vntill ſuch time as wee deſire him to bedeawe vs but commeth firſt to vs and franckly offereth himſelfe, preſenting vnto vs his onely ſonne with his doctrine: and heerein, he ſheweth himſelfe ſo louing, as that hée ought to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued without gayneſaying: yea ſhoulde not euery man be ſo ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly inflamed, as not to make any reckoning of all the reſt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer,
<pb facs="tcp:7663:104"/> for the imbraſing of this Redéemer which hath appeared. Nowe, this déede is ſo farre of, as that a man ſhall hardly find the tenth part of the hearers which ſhall bee earneſtly touched. And in déede, wee are taught by experience that ſome make a teſt at it, as commonly all theſe contemners of God doe, in whome there is as much faith &amp; religion as in a Maſtiffe Curre: accounting all whatſoeuer is preached vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euerlaſting life, but as an old wiues tale: Other ſome there are who are not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented with this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt of the word, without they go farder: for they are ſtark ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng madde at it.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, there are ſome which blaſpheme it with open mouth and otherſome deſire but to hold themſelues vnto that which they haue conceiued in their fantaſtical crowing braine. Beſides, there are ſome ſo blockiſh, as that they are neither named nor touched, more then ſtones, and otherſome there are, who though they haue a fayre cloke of godlineſſe, yet are they lyars and periured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and nothing in them but deceit and hypocriſie. This, we well enough ſée, and although the Prophet had ſaid nothing, yet we wil open our eyes, we ſhal ſée it to bée ſo. And is not this a fearefull thing, and a monſter againſt nature? yes no doubt of it.</p>
               <p>Now, héere might maruellous offences be taken, to ſerue as it were for a barre to kéepe vs from comming to the Goſpell, if wee ſhould looke into the dealings of the world, ſo that wee might ſay, what? if the word of God be our moſt excellent bleſſedneſſe and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie, how falleth it out that it is thus reiected. And beſides, what is the cauſe that God ſuffereth himſelfe thus to bee ſcorned, and reſiſted, and that he maketh them not to heare him, &amp; to giue him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> credite which apperteineth vnto him? So what te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptations héere are, to cauſe vs not to beléeue the Goſpel. Surely, héere is a great ſpeake, as though our miſbeliefe did derogate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the truth of God, and leſſened his honour. And therfore, it is not without cauſe, that the Prophet Iſaiah hath interlaced this ſaying. For if hée had ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſaide, as héere before we haue ſéene, that is, that all the worlde ſhould be bedeawed by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and that the goſpell ſhould be ſpred al ouer, &amp; kinges &amp; princes ſhould ſubiect the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vnto him: we would at this preſent ſay, ho, this was not ſpoken by the Prophet Iſaiah for our time: For we ſee al to be cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, &amp; in ſtéed that the earth ſhould be bedeawed for the obteining of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7663:104"/> ſaluation, we ſée here to be a deluge or monſtrous flood of al iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: we ſée that we become as it were brutiſhed with an helliſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, euen to the caſting of, of God &amp; all godlineſſe. To be ſhort, wée ſée the Goſpel to be ſo ill intreated, as is horrible. And ſince it is ſo, the ſaying of the Prophet ſhall not be as yet verified. Nowe, this (as I haue alredy ſaid) were euen enough to turn our faith vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide downe: but when this ſaying is ioyned with that, that went be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore: which is, that notwithſtanding that God ſendeth raine to quicken and refreſh vs, hee beſtoweth not this ſpeciall grace vpon all men, to receiue that which is ſpoken of: But that the greateſt number of the faithleſſe will haue their eares ſtopped, or els will bee ſo hard hearted as that they will bée the more inuenomed to doe miſchiefe: and the reſt will make no reckoning of the ineſtimable benefite which is communicated vnto them. Wherefore, ſéeing the Prophet hath declared all theſe things, and that wée ſée it, we muſt not be abaſhed thereat: But our faith ſhould rather be ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereby. Héere then we ſée (in ſumme) what we haue to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this. And ſo, let vs make this reckoning that the world will neuer bée conuerted vnto God in ſuch ſorte, but that Satan will haue the poſſeſſion of the greateſt number, who ſhal continue bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſhe, deſiring rather to periſh, then to receiue the benefite offered. And there are diuers kindes of them, as hath béene before ſaide: Some will bée blockiſh, ſome will haue a pride to ieſt at GOD, and bée ſo fooliſhe arrogant as to condemne all that is conteined in the Goſpell: and other ſome will bée ouer head and eares in the carckes and cares of this world, and will bee ſo preuentyng of things by their cunning and deceites, that they wil taſt of nothing that is heauenly: and other ſome will bee ſo brutiſhe as that it is impoſſible for a man to enter into their mindes, to ſhewe them any doctrine. And therefore, when wée ſée all this geare, let vs make this reckoning, that although the Goſpell bée preached, and that the voice of GOD reſoundeth and ringeth throughout the worlde, yet will a great number of people be no changelinges out continue as they were, ſo that all doctrine ſhal lye dead to them as it were. And thus much for this point. Wée ſée alſo, that the belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing number is very ſmal. And therefore we are to beware howe wee become wanton, but let vs rather vnderſtande, that whatſoeuer god hath ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he will performe. And in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mean time,
<pb facs="tcp:7663:105"/> we ſhould be the carefuller to ſhroude our ſelues vnder his wings, by reaſon that the worlde at this day is full of wickednes and rebellion In very déede, wee ought to ſtande in feare, and walke more carefully. For, if all men were well giuen to ſerue God, wee ſhoulde haue good examples on euery ſide, which ſhoulde ſufficiently ſtirre vs vp, very valiantly for our partes, to beſtowe our ſelues, but when it is ſaide, that the greateſt number of thoſe which come to heare the Goſpell preached, ſhall liue like Diuels, and nothing els to be found amongſt them but diſſoluteneſſe and wantonneſſe, ſo that a man woulde thinke that the world had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to eſtrange vs quite and cleane from God, then had we moſt neede to walke in trembling and in feare, For, if God myraculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſerued vs not, what would become of it? And therfore, let all ſuch as meane to ſtand to the goſpel, prepare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the like occaſions: although we ſee that other men do not their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as they ought, yet let vs take héede that we turne not aſide: But let vs when we ſée the whole worlde treade the word of God vnder foote, ſticke to it, and not that onely, but let vs ſo much the more duetifully ſubmit our ſelues vnto our God, whenas wee ſee that offences and euill examples, might giue vs occaſion to ſlyde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him, and continue in the Goſpell whereunto God hath called vs. Thus we ſée what it is that wee haue to conſider of the Prophetes crying out, when hee ſayeth, who will beleeue our doctrine? For, hee preſuppoſeth that the number of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will be thinne ſowen: and whenas the Goſpell ſhall be publiſhed ouer the face of the whole earth, if wée looke what great effect it hath wrought, we ſhall find, that it hath taken déepe roote but in a very fewe, for the reformation and bettering of their life, forſaking the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, and conſecrating them wholy vnto God: wée ſhall ſée, I ſay, very fewe ſuche. But hée ſetteth downe by the way, the cauſe which at this preſent wee cannot handle: to wit, that in it wee ſhoulde alſo note that faith is an eſpeciall gifte of God, and that to haue our eares beaten with the doctrine is not al, that is required: but God muſt alſo touch vs, and ſo worke in vs by his ſecrete po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, as that we may be drawne to him, and be edified by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching which is deliuered vnto vs. Howbeit becauſe we cannot goe forward with it at this preſent, therefore we will reſerue it vntyll another time.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:7663:105"/>
               <p>Nowe let vs fall downe before the Maieſtie of our good God, and acknowledge our offences, beſeeching him to make vs more and more to féele them: that we may come vnto him ſo repentant as that we neuer ceaſe all our life long to labour for it, vntill ſuch time as all our corruptions, vices, and wicked luſtes be aboliſhed and wee bee deliuered of them by his holy ſpirite looking after no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but the glorifiyng of our God. And becauſe he would haue all prayſe rendered vnto him in the perſon and mediation of his onely Sonne, let vs beſéech him, that wee may all moſte humbly imbrace this Redéemer which is offered vs: and in the meane while bée ſo mortified, as that we may bée exalted to that Maieſty which hée hath giuen vs, for the partaking of the life purchaſed by him for vs. That it woulde pleaſe him to beſtowe this grace not onely vpon vs, but vpon all people and nations of the earth. &amp;c.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue already begunne to treatiſe and ſay, that although the Goſpell ſhoulde bée publiſhed throughout the face of the whole earth, yet, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſhould be very hardly receiued, &amp; intreated, by the greateſt number: which thing the Prophet hath alſo ſo declared, to the end the children of God might not bée abaſhed, whenas they ſée the faithleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſuch as haue had their eares beaten with the doctrine of ſaluation, and yet haue cared no whit at all for the ſame. And is not this a ſtrange kinde of dealing, that when God as much as is poſſible calleth vs vnto himſelfe, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth ſo gently and graciouſly to winne vs, that we ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly drawe our heades out of the collor as wée ſay, and euen for the very nonce refuſe to receiue the benefite thus offered vnto vs? A man woulde thinke, that this were an impoſſible thing: and yet wée dayly ſée it by experience. Loe here why it is that the Prophet cryeth out, whenas God, as it were, by the ſound of a tru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pet would publiſh his Goſpel, &amp; yet y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there ſhould be notwithſtanding ſo fewe beléeuers, hée addeth the reaſon, that it was very méete that <hi>God ſhould ſhew forth his power,</hi> to graunt faith vnto thoſe which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally would be faithleſſe. What is the cauſe that wée ſée ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people reiect, loath, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue ſo great an hatred againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, &amp; had rather be like vnto them which ſo ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues againſt God, then quiethly come néere him? What is the cauſe, I ſay? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, nothing els but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we imagine we haue faith tied to our gyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels. Howbeit, the Prophet telleth vs another maner of thing, for he ſaith, that although god co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded that his word ſhould be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to all both good &amp; bad, yet worketh hée ſuch a ſecrete effect in his choſen, as if he made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> féele his arme &amp; power. And therefore let this bée our obſeruation, that whenſoeuer the Goſpell is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, it wyll bée but as an vnprofitable ſounde, vntyll ſuch time as our Lorde ſheweth that it is hée him ſelfe which ſpeaketh: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beſtoweth hee this benefite vpon all men.</p>
               <p>Thus wee ſee, the power of GOD to bee hidde from the reprobate and therfore, that this priuiledge belongeth but to a few, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath choſen &amp; adopted to attaine to euerlaſting life,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7663:106"/> whenas hée telleth them that the Goſpell is the doctrine of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and a moſt infallible trueth, whereto they muſt ſticke. Thus we ſée in ſumme, the meaning of the Prophet in this place. Nowe we muſt heereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be fenſed &amp; armed againſt this obiect which the diuel ſetteth before our eyes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>as we ſée ſuch a mightie number of people withſtand the Goſpel, euen of the greateſt and higheſt in calling: for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we think it, as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would ſay, not to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde of God. And why ſo? verily, becauſe we depend too too much vpon me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thus we ſée howe weake and vnſtable our faith is. And therefore let vs ouercome the worlde, and let vs vnderſtand that when God ſpeaketh, we muſt ſubmit our ſelues vnto him: and although none will accompanie vs héerein, but bée all againſt vs, yet let vs for al that, be contented to receiue with a pure and cleane faith, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer God ſpeaketh vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, to the end we might not be abaſhed to ſée men ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly bent as to fight againſt their God, yea euen their Creator, &amp; Redéemer, let vs therefore vnderſtande, that faith is not giuen to all men, but is a ſinguler gift which God hath reſerued as a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Iewell for his elect and choſen: and although we vnderſtande that our duetie is to cleaue vnto him, yet let vs, notwithſtanding know, that euery of vs hath not faith of our owne proper motion, but that God hath inlightened vs, &amp; made vs ſée by his holy ſpirite and in thus doing hath ſhewed his power: that is to ſay, hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs ſuch a liuely féeling thereof in our heartes, as that we may very wel know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Goſpell is not of men, but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. And this is the effect which we are to conſider of out of this place. To be ſhort, let vs boldly ſet our ſelues againſt the faithleſnes &amp; ſtubbornes of all ſuch as are the enimies of God, &amp; let vs march on, whither ſoeuer he calleth vs, &amp; receiue the benefit which he offereth vs, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end we may be found blameles of this vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kfulnes, wherof the Prophet accuſeth &amp; conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth héere, all ſuch as would not obey the doctrine of the Goſpell. Nowe héereupon he ſheweth that they vouchſafed not to beléeue Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe they ſée him as a forlorne and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temptible man.<note place="margin">

                  </note> Wherefore, ſée why it is ſaide, That he ſhoulde be placed as a precious ſtone, vpon which the Temple of God ſhoulde bée built, and ſuch a ſure ſtone as ſhoulde bee able to beare the whole building, the Prophet alſo furder ſaith, that he ſhoulde be a ſtumbling ſtone vnto the kingdome of Iuda, and to the houſe of Iſrael. And according héereunto: it is nowe ſaide that he ſhalbe as <hi>A ſmall twigge, and as a roote comming out of a dry and barren grounde:</hi> And that when he ſhould be ſéene, no man ſhoulde once vouchſafe to looke on him: but that euery man ſhoulde turne away his face from him, and abhorre him. Wée ſee nowe, that there are but a fewe which will beléeue the Goſpel: for wée ſéeke continually to make a goodly outwarde ſhew, and would gladly that all ſhoulde bée ſéene and come to light.</p>
               <p>Nowe, the dealing of the Lorde God was after another ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when he ment to redéeme vs: For, (as Saint Paule ſaith) becauſe the worlde woulde not benefite it ſelfe by the wiſedome of God, whenas he in ſuch ſorte ſhewed himſelfe the Creator, as that the very beholding of the heauen &amp; the earth might haue ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly made it to haue come vnto him,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21.</note> hee then made an alteration in the worlde, and hath vſed as it were, a certaine kinde of fooliſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to teache vs For, (as I haue ſaide) wée ſhoulde haue beene taught by the wonderfull wiſedome of God, which appeared both in the heauens and in the earth vnto the whole worlde, but wee haue béen ouer blockiſhe théerein. And therefore God hath vſed a kinde of fooliſhneſſe, when as he ſent his onely ſonne, who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelfe to all our infirmities, whom the worlde refuſed, and being borne in a Stable, lead all the dayes of his life like a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable poore handicraftes man: and at laſt, wée ſée that all men ſet themſelues againſt him: and ſo raged, as that they deteſted and hated him, and to make fewe wordes, and well crucified him.</p>
               <p>Now, this was a death which God curſed: and hée was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſfigured with buffetting, ſpitting on, &amp; crowned with thorne but alſo was accurſed, being hanged betwéene two théeues, as if hée had béene the moſt horrible villaine that euer was knowne or
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7663:107"/> hearde of. And this was a terrible kinde of death, becauſe it was accurſed by the law. We ſée how fouly hee was diſfigured: which was the very meane why he became a ſtumbling blocke vnto the worlde. And therefore, the Prophet namely ſaith that they would not beléeue the Goſpell: becauſe the world could not conceiue it to bée a reaſonable thing, neither yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>llow, that the only Sonne of God, the very glory of the Lorde, ſhoulde bée put to ſuch ſhame and rebuke: This eternall counſell of God, which was from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, coulde neuer ſinke into their braine. And thus wée ſée the meaning of the Prophet. Now it is hereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaid notwithſtanding <hi>That he ſhalbe exalted.</hi> Although at the firſt there is no ſhewe of it, yet God will increaſe him: and they ſhall ſée, ſaith he, euen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their faces, that although he was miſerable and bare, &amp; a poore twigge, yet that this was no let vnto his aduancement, nor to his glorious flooriſhing: becauſe that God woulde put his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; bring it to paſſe. And beſides, he bringeth vs backe to our ſinnes, that hee might take away our conceiued offence, by reaſon of the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwartnes of our vnderſtanding. Wherfore, to the end we ſhould not refuſe to come vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, by ſéeing him thus diſfigured, the Prophet ſheweth vs the cauſe why. For, to ſay true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if we come once to the acknowledging of our ſinnes, and foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with conceiue of the wrath of god for the ſame, then ſhall we come to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; deſire him to helpe vs, &amp; be ſo much the more earneſt to receiue his death and paſſion: for wée muſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that it is the moſt neceſſary remedy that may be, for the euil that is in vs, Thus in ſume we ſée here the procéeding of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. Now, when he maketh compariſon betwéen our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and a ſmal twigge or braunch &amp; a roote in a dry and barren ground it is to ſhew, that the beginnings ſhould be baſe &amp; of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure, ſo that all the worlde ſhould ſcoffe &amp; laugh at them. In the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuenth Chapter he compareth him vnto a ſory twigge or braunch ſaying that he ſhould come of the ſtocke of Iſai Dauid his father. And therefore, becauſe the kingly houſe was then baſe, and of no honour, hee ſaid it ſhoulde be as ſometimes it had béen, that Iſai was a countrie man, &amp; his children Neat heardes, &amp; Shepheardes. This houſe in thoſe dayes was nothing, and of no reputation: and beſides, was like vnto the body of a trée lying on the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, which men troode vpon, and of no eſtimation. Ieſus Chriſte then was
<pb facs="tcp:7663:108"/> like vnto a ſilly twigge or branche: But it is ſaide ſoone after, that hée ſhould ſo wonderfully growe, as that hée ſhoulde ouerſhadowe the whole worlde. Héere, the Prophet alſo ſheweth, that it muſte néedes bée that our Lorde Ieſus ſhoulde bee thus contemptible at the firſt. For if this had not béen namely declared, they might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well haue béen offended, whenas they ſee our Lord Ieſus Chriſt to be thus contemptible as touching the worlde. For it was ſaide, that one ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually ſit vpon the ſeat of Dauid, &amp; that this kingdome ſhould floriſh, although he held the Sun &amp; Moone. And now behold, that this princely houſe was as it were razed &amp; vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defaced: &amp; who would thinke that the promiſe ſhould be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our Lord Ieſus? For, there was no likelihood, that he ſhould haue béen reſtored to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princely eſtate, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is ſaid y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this houſe ſhould as it were come to naught, &amp; he of no more eſtimation, nor haue no more rule, &amp; preheminence, &amp; that it ſhould be aſhame, as a man would ſay, to ſée ſuch a deſtruction and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: when the Prophetes, I ſay, haue told this much, then haue wee a very good entrée, to wit, Ieſus Chriſt. Neither muſt wee bee abaſhed, as at a ſtrange &amp; vnknowne thing, although our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſhewed himſelf, in ſo baſe a ſtate and condition. For, to ſay the trueth, it is not in this place alone, that the holy Ghoſte hath thus ſaide. Wée ſée alſo what the Prophet Amos ſaith, That God will raiſe this ſeate,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Amos.</hi> 9.11 <hi>Acts.</hi> 15.16.</note> which before was ouerthrowne: And this place is alſo ſet downe in the Acts of the Apoſtles, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte ſhall beginne to raigne, when it ſhal pleaſe God to repare the things that were confounded. And namely it was ſaid, that this kingdome, with the kingly crowne, ſhoulde be trode vnder foote as it were, and haue no head, vntill ſuch time as the Redéemer were come into the worlde. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all theſe thinges ſhould confirme and ſtrengthen vs, to the end theſe baſe beginnings of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte might not ſéeme ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge vnto vs. Moreouer, by this ſaying of <hi>a deſert or barre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> land,</hi> the Prophet meaneth, that it ſhould ſéeme, that our Lorde Ieſus ſhould no more increaſe or grow vp, then a trée in the deſert, where is neither moyſtneſſe nor any goodneſſe. Behold then he is like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a diſfigured or yll fauoured trée, which wanteth nouriſhmente, and the ſubſtance and moyſture of the earth.</p>
               <p>Nowe, it is ſaide that Ieſus Chriſte ſhalbe ſo from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7663:108"/> expreſſing thereby that there ſhoulde be no meanes héere on earth to make him floriſh, but that he ſhould be increaſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, &amp; that by the ſecrete power of God his Father: and not be ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the worlde, becauſe it is altogether barren &amp; fruitleſſe. And this was not only ſaid of his byrth, but is alſo to be referred to the whole courſe of the Goſpell. In déede, this was a ſigne that Ieſus Chriſt was but a poore twig, whenas he could not get a place to be lodged amongſt men, but was like one that was baniſhed &amp; exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, &amp; ſo poorely brought vp as euer was man. And this was to prepare the hearts of the faithful to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſhould be reiected &amp; conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned as touching the world: but the principal matter for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d was, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhould come to preach the Goſpel, and execute the charge co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted vnto him by God his father. For then they began to ſay, Is not this the Carpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſonne, doe not we know his bringing vp? And in what ſchoole he hath learned to be ſo great a Doctor?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.55</note> And his kindred ſéeing him to be ſo extréemely hated, would haue made him beléeue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee had béen mad, &amp; that he muſt be tied, &amp; kept fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doing his duty, for feare the people would haue ſtoned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all to death: for they ſaw well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that this malice would ſtretch it ſelfe foorth to the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily &amp; kindred, And at laſt, behold Ieſus Chriſt was crucified. So that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man would haue thought the goſpel had béen cléerely bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him, &amp; the remembrance thereof quite put out. Who would haue ſaid that the Apoſtles had euer béen able thus to haue ſet foorth the doctrine of the Goſpell: For, marke what ſimple men they were, ſuch as neuer knew what learning meant, altogether vnacquainted with the holy ſcripture, &amp; vtterly without ſkill &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie: and beſides, a refuſe people, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no man wold vouchſafe to heare, although in very déed they had ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tongues of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. And what is to be ſéen herein, but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a very wildernes? wher are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honorable ſhewes, &amp; preparatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhould make kings &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces to ſtoupe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel. For ſooth, heere are none at al. But on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary part, behold naked ſwordes, fire &amp; faggot, to ſtop the courſe therof. Wherfore, we right wel ſée y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was like vnto a ſmal graffe planted in a barre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> land. And who would ſay y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ſhould grow to be a trée to ouerſhadow all the world, vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might ſhroud himſelf? who was euer able to immagine this, ſéeing ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely beginnings. Therefore it is not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out cauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the prophet I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaiah declareth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the world w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is too too much addicted to glory, wil
<pb facs="tcp:7663:109"/> neuer vouchſafe to looke vpon our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, but rather deſpiſe him, becauſe he is like vnto a little twigge &amp; ſcience of a trée taken out of a barren land, where was neither water, moyſture, ſubſtance, or yet ſtrength.</p>
               <p>Now, this is namely laide before vs, to the end we might not bée drawne away through any ſuch offence, but be able redily to come vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And therefore, when wee heare after what ſort the Goſpell ſhalbe preached vnto the world, and that we ſée the like of it at this day: to wit, that the church ſhalbe as a ſmall handfull of raſcall people, and that wée ſhalbe abhorred of all thoſe that beare the greateſt ſway in the worlde, let not vs for al that be faint harted. For we ſée how our Lord Ieſus Chriſt appeared at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt, &amp; although his meaning is that his kingdome ſhould bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued after this maner at this day, yet let not that ſtay vs from yéelding our obedience vnto him.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.25.</note> And ſince we know (as S. Paule ſaith) y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the fooliſhneſſe of God hath ſurpaſſed the wiſdom of man, let not vs be ſo arrogantly minded as to ſet our ſelues againſt it: But let vs vnderſtand that as God his meaning was to make his ſonne of no reputation, ſo likewiſe entended he to exalt him aboue the heauens: and let not vs finde fault with that which he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined in his ſecrete counſel, but therein reſt our ſelues.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, let vs well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider of theſe words, <hi>That he ſhall ſprout vp before him.</hi> For, if we, through our pride and diſdaine, think to tread Ieſus Chriſte vnderfoote, &amp; kéepe him vnder, we deceiue our ſelues: becauſe he ſhal grow vp in deſpite of mans incredulitie, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, vnthankfulneſſe, and enmitie, but it ſhall be, <hi>before God.</hi> It is true alſo, that he groweth vp aſwell before the faithfull: becauſe they muſt obediently worſhip him, &amp; acknowledge that the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t name which god hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, is worthie to haue euery knée bow vnto it. But the Prophet hath namely ſaid, that hee ſhall grow vp before God, ſetting héere a ballance as it were betwéene ſuch me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as goe about to ouerthrow &amp; ſuppreſſe the glory of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: and beſides, God his father who will giue him his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, wil bring it ſo to paſſe, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> nothing ſhalbe able to kéepe him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto the fruite of his glory and Maieſtie, whereunto hee is called. Thus wee ſée the very naturall and true meaning of theſe wordes, That to the outward ſhewe, our Lorde Ieſus is but as a twigge, in a dry or barren grounde, becauſe there is no meanes in this worlde to make him growe vp: and yet bée
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7663:109"/> as be may, he ſhal growe vp. But how? Forſooth, euen before God.</p>
               <p>And therefore, let it not diſmay vs, when wée ſhall ſée men make a ieſt at the Goſpell, &amp; to become as a flaunderous and ſhamefull thing, by reaſon of the pride of the faithleſſe: But when wée ſhall ſée the enimies of the trueth ware to arrogant, and lift vp their hornes againſt our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and furiouſly fight againſt him, let vs turne away our faces from it: and not be ſo fooliſhe as to ſet light by the ſonne of God, becauſe it is not the blinde, &amp; ſuch as Satan poſſeſſeth, and who are altogether bewitched, that doe praiſe and magnifie him and his worthines: but let vs rather looke vnto God, and then ſhall wée be throughly inſtructed in our faith. For ſince Ieſus Chriſte ſo groweth vp before God his Father, it is good reaſon that we for our partes ſhoulde magnifie him, and yéelde him the honour that belongeth vnto him: To bée ſhort, let vs learne to ſtay our ſelues wholy vpon god, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we may boldly &amp; fréely ſtand againſt all the world. And although there bee no rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning made of the word of God, yet let vs yéeld our obedience vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it as it were vnto himſelfe. And why ſo? Forſooth becauſe that God ſhould be far dearer vnto vs then an infinite number of thoſe gaineſayers which would withdrawe vs from comming vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. And this is a very neceſſary point for vs euen at this day: For (as wée haue ſaide) we ſée that the mightieſt and wiſeſt men of this worlde, fight notwithſtanding againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, yea euen they which are not contented to be called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians only, but which alſo will be aboue all others, in the higheſt degrées, and yet are theſe men, I ſay, but Satans ſupporters to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh the trueth of God, &amp; ſuch as ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues againſt our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt &amp; his word. If this, I ſay, feare vs let vs conſider wel of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which is héere ſaid, That if we ſée men ſo obſtinate &amp; hard har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as that they wil not receiue the ſonne of God when he offereth himſelfe vnto them, wée ought to ſet our ſelues againſt euen the mightieſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: becauſe then are but doung in reſpect of God. In very déede, as for the preſent time, they are of ſo great Maieſtie as that to our ſéeming all the world ſhould bowe &amp; tremble before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: But if we would lift vp our mindes vnto God, &amp; looke vnto him, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out doubt wee woulde care no more for al theſe fray baggles, then for a ruſh. Thus we ſée how we ſhould lift vp our faith to the end y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> nothing which is héere below, might bee any let why Ieſus
<pb facs="tcp:7663:110"/> Chriſt ſhould not rule ouer vs. And this is it which we haue to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of in this place. But becauſe God worketh after a ſtrange &amp; incomprehenſible maner, it ſhoulde confirme vs a great deale the more. For if the Goſpell were preached by men of great eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, ſo that kings and princes, and al honourable eſtates euery where ſubmitted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues vnto it, &amp; that it might bee thus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded whereunto we muſt ſticke, This is the heauenly trueth which we muſt agrée vnto? And euery man is to fauour it, and to put to all his force and ſubſtance. Nowe, this were like vnto a far grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d well tylled, planted with trées &amp; vines, &amp; ſowen with wheat, which at the world helpeth, &amp; ſpareth for no coſt. When land, then, is this tilled, &amp; hath raine in due ſeaſon: and ſhould continue ſo, euer after: and to be ſhort, no coſt to be ſpared: Why? Surely this were the very naturall &amp; kindly handeling of ground: and therefore a man woulde thinke, that God had not put his hande herevnto. But when wée ſée what diſputations and reſiſtances are at this day to oppreſſe the goſpel, &amp; what a number of hired tongues for the ſame purpoſe (for not only the popiſh hypocrites at this day, let out their tongues like co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon harlots to blaſpheme God &amp; his word, but alſo a many of curres euen amongſt vs) yet ſhal we beſides likewiſe ſee what crueltie they vſe againſt the poore childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, laying co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſtrange platfourmes to the deuiſing of Edict, vpon Edict, to bring this doctrine vtterly to naught. We ſhall alſo ſée at this day what vile and ſcornefull ſpéeches prophane men wil haue, becauſe they would aboliſh al religion. And therefore when we looke vpon al theſe things we muſt néedes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude that God is aboue them al, &amp; the doctrin victorious, &amp; procéedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wherfore, this ought to confirme vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> although we ſée there is nothing in the world to aduaunce y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dominion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; the doctrine of his goſpel, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al things rather hinder it: yet notwithſtanding, that it findeth an entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; kéepeth his courſe. In the meane while we are conuinced of vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kfulnes, if we take any offence thereat, ſéeing God calleth vs vnto himſelf, &amp; ſheweth vs, that it is his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dy worke: and therefore we muſt neceſſarily conclude, that it is mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, to ſée the goſpel thus proſper. Thus we ſée in ſumme, how we muſt put in practiſe this doctrin in theſe daies. Yet there is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, and that is this, that Ieſus Chriſt muſt be diſfigured. The Prophet hath already ſaide, That hee ſhould be like vnto a ſmall twigge: But that which is more, he ſhould bee contemned,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7663:110"/> refuſed, &amp; not once vouchſafed to be looked on, neither ſhould there be any thing in him, that were to be deſired. And this is to declare, that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſhould, as we haue already ſaid, be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtéemed of the world, and ſuffer al reproch and ſhame, as if men had not onely forſaken him, but God alſo. Now to ſéek our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is a thing ſo greatly to be deſired, in him, in whom is no kinde of likelihood, this ſhould ſeeme to be a great abuſe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if we wil come to Ieſus Chriſt, we muſt ouercome this te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now, this is a very neceſſary point, firſt, bicauſe the Iewes loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for an earthly kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for this was ſo couetous &amp; proud a natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they thought god could not ſhew himſelf merciful vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he heaped on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great riches of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might liue glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riouſly, &amp; in al pleaſure: thus we ſée, what a redemer it was y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they looked for: and yet had God throughly aduertiſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſhould be like vnto a litle twig who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world ſhuld refuſe. And this admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was not only neceſſary for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but alſo as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for vs eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at this day: for this offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce remained after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, for S. Luke ſaith, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Gentiles made a mocke as it were, at Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; the Iewes were venimouſly &amp; maliciouſly armed againſt him, &amp; ſtumbled at him as at a ſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling ſtone. And of theſe exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, we haue ynough euen at this day with vs. Wée are therfore to conſider ſo much the more of this doctrine, that is, that it muſt néedes bée that the ſonne of God muſt be thus miſhappen, and yll fauoured, and that there ſhoulde bée nothing in him woorthy commendation, in the ſight of the worlde: for by the way, we muſt alwaies haue this note which S. Iohn ſpeaketh of, that the glory of the ſonne of God appeared in him: howbeit ther were many blind fooles which neuer vnderſtood thus much. Now, when the Prophet Iſaiah ſaieth, that Ieſus Chriſt ſhalbée like a miſhappen &amp; forlorne man, &amp; ful of deformity, he ſignifieth héereby that it was impoſſible for a naturall man to vnderſtande that hée was ſent to ſaue them, &amp; that hée ſhould haue all power both of life and death, and that the fulnes of al righteouſneſſe, wiſedome, and holineſſe ſhoulde bée in him no man, I ſay, was able to conceaue this in his head. Thus we ſée how this place is to be taken: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt had done many notable miracles which teſtified his heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly power, yet for all that, he remayned ſtil diſfigured and the faithleſſe perceiued it neuer a whit.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7663:111"/>
               <p>And therefore this place of the Prophet hath fully béene accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.3.</note> that there was no gloriouſnes in Ieſus Chriſt to draw me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to like of him. It is very rightly ſaide of the Pſalmiſt, that he ſhuld be gloriouſly and beautifully lifted vp aboue al mankind: But this is a ſpiritual beautifulneſſe, accordingly as we haue already ſaid, That the glorie of the ſonne of God appeared in him: euen vnto al thoſe that had had their eyes, and were able to ſée him. Loe then how our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath ſurpaſſed all men in beautie: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God had geuen him infallible markes &amp; tokens, wherby hée might be known that he was in very déed, the liuely image of God his father.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.14.</note> We haue then ſufficient reaſon ynough to magnifie our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: Howbeit the worlde knew it not. And ſo, we muſt come backe againe vnto the ſaying of the Prophet, that euery man hath turned his backe, and cloſed vp his eyes, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a moſt horrible and deteſtable thing. What? to ſeeke for lyfe in death? to truſt to him that coulde not helpe himſelf? to ſéeke ſtrength and power in him, that was ſo weake? what a thing were this? To be ſhort, we al know, &amp; haue had too too much experience in our ſelues, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was abaſed in his death eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo wil our faith he caſt downe headlong, if it be not vpholden from elſwhere. When there is any queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſetling our ſelues vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, in running, &amp; truſting fully &amp; wholly to him, then this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth into our minds, what, how be this? why he was ſo abaſed in his death, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a man would thinke al were marred, &amp; cleane loſt. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt wee haue recourſe to this ſaying of the Prophet: that although hee was abaſed in his death, yet y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God exalted him aboue al the reſt of his creatures. And thus muſt we lift vp our faith vnto the heauens. But, hée as be may, let vs learne not to take any offence, at the crucifiyng of the ſonne of God neither yet at the ſhames &amp; ſlanders which he ſuffered in his owne perſon, nor at the diſdaining of his members at this day, and at all the reproches which are done vnto them in the whole world: let not al theſe dooings, I ſay, withdraw vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> continually remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning firme &amp; conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith of the Goſpel, Now, becauſe this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>flict is hardly to be performed, marke why y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophet brin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geth vs back to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, why our Lord Ieſus ſuffred: for, to ſay tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is impoſſible for vs to truſt vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne of god, vntil ſuch time as we are ſurely &amp; certainly perſuaded of the fruit &amp; benefit which
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7663:111"/> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth vnto vs by his death &amp; paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And why ſo? forſooth, becauſe at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt ſight (as I haue already ſaid) a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne it to be a fooliſh thing, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a mortal man ſhould be the Author of life: that he ſhould die no ſimple death, but ſuch a ſlanderous death, as God cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, euen to be hanged as a théefe vpon the Gallow trée. Now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhoulde ſée all this geare, no doubt of it, wée ſhould be brought into ſuch a maruellous hatred of the matter, as that we ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be able to come vnto Ieſus Chriſt, but héere is the righteſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie that we haue, that we vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d why he died, how his death hath profited vs, &amp; what benefit we haue receiued by it: &amp; then wée ſhall auoyde all offences. As for exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, if griefe &amp; ſorrow oppreſſe my hearte, and doe beholde the onelie Sonne of God to bée, as it were, troade vnder foote, and abhorred of all men, I muſt néeds enter into a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration with my ſelfe: For if I looke but only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ieſus Chriſt, I ſhal paſſe it ouer, &amp; make no reckoning of it: but if in the firſt place I looke vnto my ſelfe, &amp; afterwarde come vnto him, then ſhal I finde a good ſauour and taſte in his ſuffering. And how ſo? Forſooth if I conſider with my ſelfe that I am a miſerable ſinner, and haue ſo prouoked the wrath of God againſt me, as that he is become mine enemy, and my Iudge: if then I thinke of my ſinnes, and therevpon doe conceyue what an horrible and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing the wrath of God is, and that hée is my iudge to caſt mée into the bottomleſſe pitte of hell, then will I begin to ſay, Goe to now, what meane haſt thou to make an attonement betwéen God and thée? Art thou able any way to ſatiſfie him, only for the leaſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence that thou haſt committed againſt him? Alas no, thou arte no way able. Can I with trauelling by Sea and lande all the worlde ouer, be able to make recompence? Can the Angels of heauen helpe mée? No ſurely. Why then it is Ieſus Chriſt alone that muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare for mée in my name, &amp; he muſt bée my pledge and warrant. Thus we ſée that the death and paſſion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt ſhalbee no more any fooliſhneſſe vnto vs: but wee ſhall thinke that becauſe wée were thus accurſed, and had no remedie to find fauour at the handes of GOD, ſince we had ſo prouoked him to bée our enimie, it could not bée choſen but that wee muſt néeds bée eftſoones ſubiect to Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; vnto his tiranny, vntil ſuch time as Ieſus Chriſt had deliuered &amp; quited vs of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Thus we ſée how we ſhould begin
<pb facs="tcp:7663:112"/> to magnifye the infinit goodneſſe of this our God, which is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring our ſinnes, and by being a ſhamed of them as much as is poſſible. We alſo ſée how this imaginatiue offence and fond deuice of the death and paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, ſhall bee blotted out, to wit when we ſhal enter into the conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our ſelues, and truly trie our ſinnes, and acknowledge that we are ſo deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto God, as that he him ſelfe muſt néedes come in the perſon of his ſonne to make ſatiſfaction for them, &amp; to repayre our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to the ende we might be reconciled vnto him. And this is héere the order of the Prophet On the one ſide he ſayeth, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſhall haue nether forme nor faſhion, and that nothing ſhall be founde in him worthy to bée deſired. And that which is more, to ſée him a farre of, would make a mans hart yarne. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, when he had ſaid all this, he addeth, <hi>Now, it was for our ſins, that he was afflicted.</hi> As if he had ſaide, Ah miſerable blind ſoules, you make no reckoning of the ſonne of God: yea and euery of you through your vnthankfulneſſe ſhutteth the gate ſo hard vpon him-as that you are no way able to come néere him, to obtaine the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation which he bringeth you. And what ſhould be the cauſe? truly, for that you haue not knowne your ſins, that you might be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and becauſe you are drowſy and blockiſh, and féede your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues with your vaine flatteries: but looke into your miſeries &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and then wyll you be aſhamed of your ſtate &amp; conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; acknowledge that you haue none other meane, but Ieſus Chriſt alone to be your mediator, who taketh vpon his owne perſon, the thing which made you the enimies of God, who becommeth your pleadge, &amp; maketh him ſelfe as a poore ſinner, to lay vpon his own ſhoulders y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your ſins. Now, when you ſhal think vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all theſe things, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil you find ſome good ſauor to ſubmit your ſelues vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne of God: &amp; not cleaue any more to your vain fantaſies, nether yet be offended that Ieſus Chriſt was thus bacely accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, whenas you ſhall vnderſtande in what condemnation you haue deſerued, and the recompence and ſatiſfaction due for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. Moreouer, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet namly ſaith, <hi>we haue ſeene him, &amp; diſdained him,</hi> therby to declare, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our Lord Ieſus ſhould not only be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; reiected of the ſmaleſt nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of people, but euen of the greteſt nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of his peculier people. for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophet ſetteth hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ranke of thoſe which had refuſed our Lord Ieſus, he had a regard vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people of the Iewes, whereof he came: and he ment alſo, ouer and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:7663:112"/> beſides this, to ſhewe that this was the common opinion as a man would ſay, that Ieſus Chriſt was reiected in all places. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are ſo much the more ſurely armed, not to tie our ſelues to mens fantaſies, when as we ſhall not onely ſée in this behalf hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreths of infidels, but alſo great troupes, and mightie armies, yea Myllions, that a man ſhall hardly finde thrée or foure amongſt an hundreth, which will quietly ſubmit them ſelues vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: and albeit we ſée it to be thus, yet let vs for all that cleaue faſt vnto him. Thus we ſée in ſumme, what we haue to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of, in this place. For, if we ſhould at this day come to voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and a fewe weake people ſhould beholde it, what? would they ſay, There is but a ſmall handfull of men which beléeue the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: howbeit, if they were the greater number, I could bée well contented to goe that way: but for mée, to thruſt my ſelfe into ſo ſmall a company, and forſake the greater multitude, what a folly were that? Now, the Prophet, to the end hée might cut the throat of theſe obiections, ſayeth, that there woulde not be aboue foure or tenne at the moſt, but that all men for the more parte, woulde refuſe to obey our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. And no doubt of it, his meaning was to finde fault perticulerly with the Iewes: For wée haue alredie alledged out of the eight Chapiter, that hée ſhould be a ſtumbling blocke to theſe two houſes, to wit, to the trybe of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham. Wée ſée then, that a man would haue thought that the people whom God had ſpecially choſen to him ſelfe, muſt néedes haue knowne their Redéemer. For, to whom was Ieſus Chriſt promiſed? Forſooth, euen to the Iewes: For it is ſaide, that he was the Miniſter of the Circumciſion, to the ende hée might accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhe the promiſes made vnto the Fathers.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.22</note> And therefore the Iewes muſt néedes bée acquainted with Ieſus Chriſt before he appeared vnto the worlde, and with eaſe receiue him: Nowe, it is ſayde, that the principall and chiefe builders refuſed him, to wyt, the Princes and heades of the people. And euen ſo fareth it at this day: For, not onely Turkes, and Infidelles refuſe Ieſus Chriſt, but alſo verie many falſe Chriſtians in name: yea, and wée ſhall haue numbers that profeſſe the Goſpell, who many tymes, become prophane, and villainous ſcorners of God, and woulde gladly that all the doctrine of ſaluation were clearely aboliſhed: for the ſhewe that they make of it, is
<pb facs="tcp:7663:113"/> onely for the ſhame of men. But howeuer it is, we are ſure of this, that Ieſus Chriſt ſhall be refuſed and contemned: and if it had not béen ſo foretold of, our fayth might very wel haue bin ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. But this ſaying of Iſaiah is a verie good ſtaffe for vs to leane vnto, euen as vnto a ſure rock, when as we ſée all the worlde thus ſtumble at him, as to ſée ſome, to ſet them ſelues furiouſly againſt him &amp; his doctrine, ſome to ſcorne him, and put out their tongues to ſpeake euill of all religion. But yet let vs notwithſtanding, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly perſeuere in our Fayth. Surely, it is greatly to be wiſhed for, that we might ſée Ieſus Chriſt a far off, and ſubmit our ſelues vnto him, becauſe hée is the true Glaſſe and patterne of al holines. Howbeit, the more we ſée the world refuſe him, the greater ought our fayth to be. For howe is it poſſible for vs to diſcerne, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is the Redéemer of the worlde? Forſooth, let vs conſider what all the Prophets haue ſaide of him. For, to ſay truely, this is the onely Glaſſe, wherein we muſt beholde the onely Sonne of God: For, behold the true teſtimonies which God hath ſent down from heauen to ſet a ſure marke of him, that ſhould be the Redée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, to wit, that all the worlde ſhould forſake him, and euery man lift him ſelfe vp againſt him. And therefore ſince it is ſo, let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him with this condition, and not doubt, that although it ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to vs, that we ſhould be vtterly ouerthrowne, and troad vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foote through the boldneſſe and pride of the vngodly, yet that God will magnifie our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and ſo ſtrengthen our fayth by his holie ſpirit, as that it ſhall haue victorie vnto the end: and that as our Lorde Ieſus hath ouercome the Deuill, as in the end, both hée, and all his Supporters, muſt be made his footeſtoole: euen ſo likewiſe, will hée cauſe vs to tryumph with him to march vpon all thoſe which perſecute, and lift them ſelues vp ſo furiouſly againſt vs, and againſt all thoſe which contemne, and deſpight him.</p>
               <p>Nowe, let vs fall downe before the Maieſtie of our good God, and acknowledge our offences, beſéeching him to cauſe vs ſo to féele them, as that we may grone and ſigh for them, ſo that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after, truely humbled, may come to our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, knowing that in him muſt be all our helpe and comfort. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as, it pleaſed God his Father to puniſh him for our ſinnes, Let vs ſet all our affection vpon him: and be ſo willingly gréeued
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7663:113"/> for our prouoking of our God vnto anger, as that we may haue, both our ſelues, and our ſinnes, in deteſtation and hatred, vntill ſuch time as we be throughly cleanſed of them. And that it would pleaſe him in the mean time ſo to aſſiſt vs, as that we neuer dout, but that hée will be alwayes mercifull vnto vs, becauſe that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath not once onely ſuffred to aboliſh our ſinnes, but alſo, daily offreth vs forgiueneſſe of the ſame, when as we ſéeke that, at his handes, which is wanting in vs. So let vs beſéech him, that hée will not onely graunt vs, this grace, but vnto all people and nations of the world, &amp;c.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen wee beholde all the woorkes of GOD héere in this worlde, wee are taught to prayſe him according to his excellency and highneſſe: But when we looke vpon the perſon of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, wée are then to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him in his lowlineſſe and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Héere then are two manner of wayes ſet downe vnto vs howe to praiſe God, The one is, Becauſe hée
<pb facs="tcp:7663:114"/> ſheweth vs his infinite goodneſſe, righteouſnes and power, in the creation and framing of all things, and in the ordering and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the ſame, therefore we ought alſo to honour and exalt him, not that we are able, to make him honourable: But the ſcripture vſeth this kinde of ſpéech, to the ende we might lift vp our mindes vnto heauen, aboue all worldly things, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we would glorifie our God according vnto his worthines. The other is, that becauſe our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, in whom dwelleth the fulneſſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, was not onely abaſed for our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but alſo wold be made of no reputation, no not refuſing to ſuffer the ſharpe anguiſhes of death, as if he had entred into hell: for this cauſe therfore, I ſay, is God more to be glorified, then for all the mightie gloriouſneſſe that is to be ſéene in all the worlde beſides. And of this we ſpake ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what yeſterday: But becauſe the Prophet goeth on with the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we are to ayme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually at this marke, that where the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe are abaſhed, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they ſée how God y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father, hath after this ſort afflicted &amp; tormented his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; do take occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of offence to eſtrange themſelues far from him, we, ought ſo much the rather to be ſtirred vp to ſéeke after him, &amp; to be farther in loue with him, ſince he ſpared not himſelf to take vpon him our whole burthen, that we might be eaſed therof. And therfore, when as wée ſée that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath made ſuch an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nowe, it is ſaide,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he was afflicted by the hande of God:</hi> but it was for our tranſgreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. For if we looke into the iudgement of God, the death and paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſhal be to vs as an vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing, neither ſhal we receiue any fruite or benefit thereby. For the principal point is, that we might be at an attonement w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God, who is our enemy, vntil ſuch time as our offences are buried, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that he who is the fountain of righteouſnes, cannot abide to loue iniquitie. And therefore, ſo long as he imputeth vnto vs our ſins, &amp; ſeeth what we are, he muſt néeds be our iudge: But when as Ieſus Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth betwéene vs &amp; him, &amp; ſpeaketh for vs, we are
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7663:114"/> then acceptable in the ſight of God, becauſe he hath made ſatiſfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for all our iniquities. For, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation which our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſuffred, cannot be vaine. Now, hée, in very déed had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no fault, neither was he guiltie in any thing. And therefore he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned, that we might be pardoned:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1. Pet.</hi> 1.19.</note> for the which cauſe he is called the immaculate Lambe, which ſheweth, that hée beare our burthen. And for this cauſe alſo is it ſaid, that his blood, is our waſhing: For we are abhominable filthy &amp; foule, vntil ſuch time as the blood of our lord Ieſus Chriſt cleanſeth vs. Wherfore, it is not for naught, that the Prophet bringeth vs back to the conſideration of Gods iudgement, ſaying, That Ieſus Chriſt was afflicted, that hée might beare our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation. To be ſhort, ſo often as we think for what cauſe it is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the death &amp; paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath done vs good, let euery of vs put himſelf ouer vnto the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat of God: and there we ſhall finde that we are worthie of death. Now, what is the rigour of Gods iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; how horrible is his vengeance? Surely, it is euen to ſwallow vs vp, &amp; to caſt vs all down headlong into the bottomles pit of hell. Howbeit, becauſe God ſpared not our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, but laide the rigour of his iudgement on him, &amp; that hée became our pledge, we may nowe be aſſured, that God will no longer purſue vs, nor call vs to any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reckoning, neither yet puniſh vs according to our deſerts and offences. And why ſo? Forſooth, becauſe Ieſus Chriſt hath cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcharged vs of them all. Now, this is true, that God was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer otherwiſe affected towardes his onely Sonne, then as hée had pronounced, when as hée ſaide,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 17.5. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.6.</note> This is my beloued Sonne in whom I am well pleaſed, heare him. God then had long before ſaide, that Ieſus Chriſt contented him verie well, and that in him was his whole delight. And in déede (as S. Paule to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians ſaith) it were impoſſible for vs to be acceptable before the lord God, in the name of his onely ſonne, without in the firſt place hée were the beſt beloued, and in the higheſt degrée.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, this was no let to our diſcharge, becauſe God had laide his rigour vpon our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: For, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hée loued him, yet would hée afflict him for our offences. For hée had no regarde to the righteouſnes, ſinceritie, and perfection that was in him: But rather tooke him as one that beare the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all ſinners vpon him.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7663:115"/>
               <p>Thus we ſée howe Ieſus Chriſt was charged w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all our ſins &amp; ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities: not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hée was any way guiltie of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but would haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all to be imputed vnto him, and take the reckoning vpon him, and the payment. Wée ſée then howe the wordes of the Prophet are to be vnderſtood, when hée ſaieth that Ieſus Chriſt was not cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied onely by the handes of men, but that hée alſo ſtood foorth before the iudgement ſeate of God, anſwered for vs, and ſubmitted him ſelfe to beare the burthen which wée were worthie to haue borne. Marke alſo why hée ſayeth,</p>

                  <hi>That hee beare all our ſinnes and tranſgresſions,</hi> for ſo are alſo the wordes of Saint Peter, who naming the Croſſe, meant to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deu.</hi> 21.23.</note> that, that kinde of death which the ſonne of God ſuffred, was a viſible and open teſtimony, that our iniquities were layde vpon him: becauſe it was ſaide in the lawe, curſed be hée that hangeth on trée. Ieſus Chriſt was hanged thereon, to the ende wée might vnderſtande and knowe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gala.</hi> 3.13.</note> that hée was as one accurſed in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, according to the ſaying of Saint Paule to the Galathians. For hée there telleth vs, that therin wée are to conſider of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull goodneſſe of God, and of the infinite loue of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt to vs warde, when as hée was not onely contented to dye for vs, but ſuffred alſo a moſt curſed death, to the ende wée might be bleſſed of God. And although our ſinnes and iniquities haue terrefied vs (for it could not be choſen but that wée muſt be afeard of the iudgement of God, when as we heare the thinges that are héere ſet downe: to wit, that wée are abhominable by reaſon of our thus offending our good God, and that our conſcience ſo telleth vs) yet let vs be aſſured that hée will forgiue vs our ſinnes, &amp; receiue vs as his beſt beloued children: yea, euen as iuſt &amp; righteous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, becauſe our curſe was aboliſhed by this Gallow trée, wheron our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt was hanged. Loe, héere the meaning of the Prophetes ſpéech, for the more liuely ſetting foorth of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>Nowe, hée eftſoones ſetteth downe, <hi>That hee was afflicted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the correction, or chaſtiſement of our peace was laide vpon him,</hi> hée ſet downe no ſtraunge thing, but declared him ſelfe more familiarly, that hée might ſhewe howe the thing was to bée vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and taken: which was, that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt was beaten and ſmitten by the hande of God, to the ende wée might bée
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:7663:115"/> diſcharged. And therfore hée beare the correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of peace which was due to vs. In déede ſome men vnderſtand it, that it was méete that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt ſhould be thus puniſhed for our ſakes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wée were ſtubborne, &amp; that none of vs thought once to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelues before God, but were altogether blinded in our offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Howbeit we ſée that this is the naturall meaning of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, that for the obtaining of peace at the handes of God, it muſt néedes be that we were to be reconciled by an other meane. I haue alredie ſaid, that God being the iudge of the world, could not chooſe but of verie right, hate and deteſt vs: for (as ſhall be ſoone after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) what haue we brought out from the wombe of the ſea, and what treaſure haue wée gathered together all our life long? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wée doe nothing els but prouoke the wrath of God, as if wée had made a league with Satan, continually to encreaſe, more and more, his fury. Sée nowe, in what ſorte wée haue deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to bée hated and reiected at the handes of God: Beholde how his wrath is kindled againſt vs? and it is impoſſible but that hée muſt néedes be our enemy, becauſe wée fight againſt him, and with might and mayne make ſuche warres, as that we vyolate and breake all order of iuſtice. And therefore (I ſay) muſt God, in this reſpect, ryſe vp in iudgement agaynſt vs: becauſe, wée knowe it to bée his verie office, to maintaine and defende equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and right. Wherfore ſince it is ſo, that he ſeeth vs to be ful of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquitie and corruption, and altogether rebellious, it is meete hée ſhoulde ſtretch foorth his arme, and ſhewe, that becauſe we are his enemyes, hée will render vs the lyke.</p>
               <p>And therefore wée had néede to haue peace, and our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will alwayes witneſſe agaynſt vs: and although wée goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout careleſly to ſleape in our flatteryes, yet will GOD ſo pricke and ſpurre vs, and make vs féele in deſpight of our téeth, that wee are altogether malicious and vnthankfull. Wherefore it is impoſſible that GOD ſhoulde bée mercifull vnto vs, and wée to bée aſſured to finde fauoure with him, vntill ſuch tyme as wée féele his correction. Not that GOD is deſirous of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge as men are.</p>
               <p>For, a man when he is in an heate, woulde haue the fault that is committed to bee amended, and ſome redreſſe and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to be made, and had, that hee might be reuenged. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
<pb facs="tcp:7663:116"/> there are no ſuche paſſions in God. But how euer the caſe ſtandeth, God will haue his iuſtice and iudgement to be knowne and feared, to the ende wée might the rather bée afearde of our ſinnes, and learne to abhorre and deteſt them. For if GOD woulde haue forgiuen vs, except Ieſus Chriſt had made interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and pawned him ſelfe for vs, wée woulde haue made no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the matter: and euerie of vs woulde haue ſmoothed him ſelfe, and woulde haue taken alſo a greater occaſion of lycenſe to ſinne. But when we ſée that God hath not ſpared, ſo rigorouſly and extreamely to handle his onely Sonne, as that hée did not onely cauſe him to ſuffer the moſt gréeuous torments in body that might bée, but alſo, ſo extremely afflicted his ſoule, as that hée made him to crye out and ſay, My God, My God, why haſte thou forſaken mée?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.46.</note> When wée ſée all theſe thinges, I ſay, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible (except our heartes bée harder then flynt ſtones) but that wée muſt bée gréeued, and conceiue ſuche a feare, as that it muſt vtterly confounde vs: and neyther will nor chooſe but deteſt our ſinnes and iniquities, ſince they ſo prouoke the heauy wrath of God againſt vs.</p>
               <p>Thus wée ſée why it was requiſite that our whole correction of peace ſhoulde bée layde vpon Ieſus Chriſt, to the ende wée might finde fauour before God his Father: that is to ſay, that we might be at ſuch a league with him, as that we might at this day be bold, and frée, to call vpon God as our Father, although of very right hée is our enemy, and hateth vs, as wée are in our owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Wée ſée then at this preſent, what the Prophet his meanyng is, when hée ſayeth, that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt was afflicted by the hande of God, diſfigured, and forſaken of all men, and that no man once vouchſafed to looke vpon him, by reaſon of his meruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous deformitie. Howbeit, hée ſayeth, that it was becauſe God had kindled his wrath againſt vs, and was armed and bent to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founde and throwe vs downe headlong into the pit of hell, vntill ſuch time as that attonement was made. And which way came it to paſſe? Forſooth, God of his méere mercy and goodneſſe, fréely forgiueth vs our ſinnes: howbeit, the price of our redemption was in the perſon of his onely Sonne.</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:7663:116"/>
               <p>Now we haue héere to note that by reaſon of the condemnation of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, we are pardoned, and al our ſinnes buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp; ſhal neuer again riſe vp againſt vs before the maieſty of God: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſpeak of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forgiuenes of our ſins, it is not ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as though God had ſo diſcharged vs, as if we, had throughly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented &amp; payde him: but we are acquited by his méere liberality. And although we are guilty before him, yet forgetteth he al, &amp; receiueth vs to mercie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.19.</note> becauſe, as the prophet ſaith, he caſteth our ſins into the bottome of the ſea: but by the way we haue alſo here to note, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this was no frée forgiuenes vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our lord Ieſus Chriſt, for it coſt him the ſetting on, as we ſay. Now if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, what a grieuous, cruel, &amp; ſlanderous death this was which he abode: &amp; beſides, what angui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes his ſoule endured, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was called before the iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſeat of God his father to abide our conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation: if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider wel, of all this geare I ſay, we ſhal find y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath made a woonderful payme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the diſcharging of our ſins. Loe here, howe we at this day are fréed of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And héerof, we are throughly to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: for the diuel hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually gone about to darke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this doctrine, becauſe it is the chiefeſt article of our faith. In the beginning of the world, God would haue ſacrifices offred vnto him, for the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinnes. And why was that? Forſooth, it was to this ende and purpoſe, that men ſhould not truſt vnto him, but by the meane of a ſacrifice and the ſhedding of blood. And therefore, they all prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in their ſacrifices y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were not able to come néere vnto god, except they had béen redéemed, by the purging of their ſinnes &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities, which was to be done, by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And yet by the way, neither Iew nor Gentile but truſted to their own me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, &amp; thought themſelues able to make ſatiſfaction vnto God by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Here then we ſée, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> diuel eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>drew miſerable ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> payment which he had made by his death &amp; paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And yet now, ſée in what caſe the papiſts are For they wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that wee haue full remiſſion of our ſinnes by the death and paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, yea, but that is as they thinke onely before baptiſme. For thus they reaſon: little children, ſay they, receiue the grace of God, and are pardoned of Originall ſinne in baptiſme, by the power of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death and paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: But ſay they, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are once baptized &amp; then ſin Ieſus Chriſt alone, is not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to make vs acceptable
<pb facs="tcp:7663:117"/> vnto the Lord and to blot out the remembrance of our ſins, but we our ſelues alſo muſt make recompence. And this is the cauſe of the deuiſing of their workes of ſuperogation: as to wander vp &amp; down lyke Rogs a Pilgrimage, to haue many trentals of Maſſes, &amp; ſuch lyke diueliſh inuentions. So, that if a man aſke the Papiſts why the roge vp and downe a pilgrimage as they doo, to ſée their mow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apes and marmeſets, why they faſt ſuch and ſuch a daye, why they build Churches, and why they cauſe maſſes to bee ſonge: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth wyll they ſay, euen to redéeme our ſelues before the Lord our God: for, it is very méete that when we haue vnderſtood of our ſins, that we ſhould make ſatiſfactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end God might acquite &amp; diſcharge vs of the ſame. Sée here, how they make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death &amp; paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our lord Ieſus Chriſt of none effect: &amp; ſo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> papiſts are not able to go on, one foot forward to do their deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they blaſpheme God ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly deny the death &amp; paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; caſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues down into hel mouth: thus we ſée, whether their diueliſh deuotions (which they cal good) lead the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And therfore we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the words of the Prophet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith, that the correction of our peace, was laid vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by his meane God is appeaſed &amp; ſet at one with vs for hée beareth all the ſinnes &amp; iniquities of the world vpon him. So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, let vs here note, that when we ſée what maner ones we are, we ſhuld alwaies ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in feare, becauſe God is our enemie, &amp; our iudge. And beſides, wée muſt in the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d place co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that there is no other meane either in heauen or yet in the earth to make vs at one with God, but by the price which our lord Ieſus hath paid &amp; ſatiſfied, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his death &amp; paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Haue we this? let vs then with bold chéere, &amp; countenance, come before our God: &amp; yet not ſo but that we muſt alwaies hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelues, &amp; be aſhamed of our ſinnes: Howbeit, that wil be no let vnto vs, but that we may frankly cal vpon our God as vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our father, neither coulde wee glorify our ſelues, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out he reputed vs to be iuſt, &amp; al our debts payd, becauſe we are pardoned by the power of the condemnation which Ieſus Chriſt ſuffred. Thus we ſée, how this place muſt be practiſed of vs, Marke alſo why hee ſaieth, <hi>That wee are healed by his woundes.</hi> In very déede, we ſhal neuer bée able to ſée throughly into our ſinnes, becauſe hipocriſie blindfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth our eyes, &amp; pride hath alwaies mighty rule ouer vs: &amp; therfore wee greately deceiue our ſelues, and make our ſelues beléeue that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7663:117"/> God is highly beholden vnto vs: or els, wée are ſo blockiſh, as that wée neuer thinke to come to a reckoning. Now, it falleth out here, that the Prophet ſheweth, that wée are but dead, if it were not for the woundes of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and therfore that we muſt néedes ſéeke to be healed by him. When then wée would féele the benefite which commeth vnto vs by the death and paſſion of the Sonne of God, Let vs note, that looke howe many ſinnes as are rooted in our nature, although they appeare not, are euen ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deadly woundes and diſeaſes. I beſéech you, if there ſhall be an Apoſtume about the ſtomake of a man, or in his bowels, ſhould it be euer a whit the woorſe for the man if it were ſéene, that it might be launced: If a man then thinketh him ſelfe to be whole and ſound, becauſe he will not ſée his diſeaſe, ſurely, he muſt néedes be voide of all wit and reaſon. And therefore our diſeaſes muſt bée ſo much the more deadly, when as they are ſecret and not knowne. And, ouer &amp; beſides the ſinnes which we beare about with vs (the rootes of which are hid in vs) there are ſinnes in vs which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit daily, which ſufficiently declareth, that our nature is fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and curſed, and that wée are altogether peruerted. Wherfore ſince wée are wholly infected with ſpirituall leproſie, and that our iniquitie is rotten in vs, what ſhall wée doe in this caſe? &amp; what remedie is to bée had? Shall wée ſéeke for helpe at the Angels in heauen? Alas, they can doe no good: and therefore we muſt go vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe hée would bee diſfigured euen from the crowne of the head, vnto the ſoale of the foote, would be al to wounded, ſcourged and buffeted with one blow vpon an other, crowned with thorns, tyed &amp; faſt nayled to the Croſſe, and at laſt perſed through the ſide with a ſpeare. And here we ſee how wée are healed, here is the right medicine for our diſeaſe, wherwith we muſt be contented, &amp; whervnto alſo we muſt apply our whole affection, knowing that we are neuer able to be at quiet with our ſelues but that we muſt ſtil be extreamly tormented &amp; vexed, were it not that Ieſus Chriſt comforted vs, and appeaſed the wrath of God for vs. Now, when wée are ſure of this, it giueth vs occaſion to ſing prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes vnto his holy name, where before, wée could doe nothing elſe, but grone, and be vtterly confounded. And this is in ſumme the thing which we are to learne out of the words of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet. Now S. Matthew, alledgeth this place,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.17.</note> when he maketh mention of all
<pb facs="tcp:7663:118"/> the diſeaſes which our Lord Ieſus Chriſt healed, how he made the blinde to ſée, the lame to goe, the deafe to heare, ſet a foote ſuche as were half dead, &amp; ſick of the palſie, &amp; caſt deuils out of mens bodies. This (ſaith hée) declareth, that it was not for naught that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Iſaiah ſaid, that hée beare our infirmities, and ſuſteined our griefes. Without doubt, the Prophet ſpeaketh not héere of bodely diſeaſes. Wherefore, it ſéemeth that the Euangeliſt hath applyed this teſtimony but yll. But hée, in declaring that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt healed outward diſeaſes, meaneth to bring vs to an higher conſideration, becauſe he would haue vs to beholde as it were in a figure, the reaſon of his comming into the world. And therfore, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we heare, that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt healed the ſicke of the palſy, but eſpecially rayſed the dead, &amp; that hée alſo healed al maner of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, let vs vnderſtand eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the view of the eye, according to our groſe &amp; weak capacities, that he hath told vs that he is our ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Phiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; let vs alſo learn (as I haue alredy ſaide) that all the vices wherevnto we are enclined, are ſo many corruptions in our ſoules. And as there are many euil humors in the body, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are there many other like things: To be ſhort, there are many ſecret diſeaſes &amp; euen ſo fareth it w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our ſoules: &amp; becauſe they are ful of vices before the lord God, they had alſo néed of a phiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And who ſhal he be? we ſhall not finde him either in heauen or in earth, except it be he who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the heauenly father hath giuen vs: to wit, our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And therfore if we can reach to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding how our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath brought health to our ſoules, let vs come to figure out y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which is here ſhewed vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he made the blinde to ſée: for, this is out of al doubt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our ſoules are both blinde &amp; beaſtly. Beſides, Ieſus Chriſt, made the dumbe to ſpeak. Nowe, we giue our tongues to nothing els but to wickednes, vntill ſuch time as Ieſus Chriſt hath giuen it the right vſe. And we are more then deafe, becauſe the word of God can haue no entrance into vs, &amp; therfore it is our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt that muſt giue vs alſo our hearing. To be ſhort, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhal ioyne the words of S. Mathew, with the meaning of the Prophet Iſaiah: to wit, that we for our partes are full of corruption, &amp; villainy &amp; that there is no health in vs, &amp; our ſoules full of all deadly ſinnes: But that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath ryd vs of them all, &amp; that in comming to him, wée ſhall finde health: when I ſay, wée ſhall thus ioyne one with an other,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7663:118"/> then ſhall we vnderſtand, that except we haue recourſe vnto this Redéemer, we muſt néedes alwaies lye ſtone ſtil in our ſinnes and miſeries, &amp; rot altogether in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And thervpon he goeth on farther, and ſaith, <hi>That we haue all declined &amp; gone aſtray.</hi> Here, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet meaneth, better &amp; more liuely to tell (as yeſterday we hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it) that wée cannot in good earneſt feele our neceſſitie to be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, vntill ſuch time as euery of vs hath truely examined his owne eſtate, &amp; knoweth what is within him. For, what is the reaſon why we are ſo cold &amp; ſlack, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are told of comming vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt? Truely, it is becauſe wée haue no capacitie, but are like verie blockheads. For, we ſhall ſée howe theſe common drunkardes are knoden together in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperancy, &amp; will neuer giue ouer, vntil ſuch time as they gnaſhe their téeth, &amp; are able to doe no more. If a man ſpeake to them of phiſicke &amp; Phiſitions, hée ſhall be but ſcorned for his labour: they will wagge the head, yea, &amp; deſpiſe all helpes. Nowe, there is not a worſe kinde of drunkenneſſe, then this blockiſhnes wherin all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſinners are ouerwhelmed, vntill ſuche time as they féele what it is to haue God their enemy. So then, euery man will giue him ſelfe ouer to all kinde of lewdneſſe, &amp; by that meane, the death &amp; paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſhall be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temned, &amp; no account made of it. And therefore it is not without cauſe that the Prophet for the awaking of vs, &amp; for the beſtowing, of the moſt deſired be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite that may be, which is brought vnto vs by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, ſheweth that we haue all erred &amp; gon out of the way. Now, ouer and beſides that I haue ſaide, that as there are prophane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of the iudgement of God, euen ſo alſo are there fooliſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous and arrogant men. Wherfore there are two ſortes of people which cannot doe them ſelues any good by this infinit grace and fauour which the Sonne of God hath purchaſed for vs: becauſe the one ſort of them thinke them ſelues to be righteous, and haue workes and merites able to anſwere the iuſtice of God. As we ſée theſe Popiſh hypocrites, who doe not onely thinke themſelues, to be diſcharged before God, but doe alſo ſell ſome parte of their merites, as if they had a ſuperfluitie of them: and that man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is well at eaſe and happie, that may be partaker of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and holineſſe, becauſe they are in an Angellike eſtate.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7663:119"/>
               <p>Now, theſe men thinke that they haue no néede of the death and paſſion of Ieſus Chriſt: but they will partly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that they haue néede: and yet we ſée it cleane otherwiſe: becauſe they kéepe faires and merkets of their merites, and haue of them to ſell and reſell, to the ende they would haue others to ſettle them ſelues and truſt vpon ſuch profanation. Moreouer, forſomuch as there is in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, both men and women hypocrites, they are euen ſo many hornes or powers ſet vp againſt God: For this pride is alwayes in them, to ſay, what good Syr? I beſéech you if I deſerue not, to what purpoſe were it for mée to haue ſo many good deuotions, to cauſe ſo many Maſſes to be ſoonge, to haue chaunted ſo muche, to haue runne ſo many times from one Aulter to an other, to haue praied to ſuch a Saint, &amp; to haue made ſuch &amp; ſuch a feaſt: To bée ſhort, they haue alwayes this curſed &amp; helliſh opinion with them, that God is bound, &amp; greatly beholde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto them. Thus we ſée howe Satan ſo deceiueth them with ſuch illuſions, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly féele to what end the death &amp; paſſion of our lord Ieſus Chriſt ſerueth them. The other ſort, truſt not to their merittes, for drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kardes, whoremongers, and wanton people will not ſay, wée are like vnto litle Angels, we haue liued well, we haue béen earneſt in our deuotions: But wil ſport them ſelues (as I haue alredie ſaid) and think to eſcape the hand of God by mocking and ſcorning. And for this cauſe, the Prophet calleth vs all here, &amp; ſaith, Conſider yée poore ſoules in what caſe you ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, vntil ſuch time as God hath ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed you his compaſſion in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt his Sonne: For you haue al erred, &amp; are al like loſt ſhéepe. Mark his meaning: for he ſaith, <hi>We all,</hi> becauſe he putteth in himſelf. Yea verely, for we haue alredie ſéene, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Iewes were included within this general curſe of men, becauſe they thought that they ſhould haue bin exempt out of it: For they were euer thus fooliſh arroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as to think y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> becauſe God had adopted &amp; choſen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were a great deale more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy then the reſt. Now, the Prophet foldeth them vp here in euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting death, vntil ſuch time as they ſéeke for the remedie of their deliuerance in Ieſus Chriſt. We are then all included within this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation: &amp; he putteth in this word, <hi>All,</hi> to the end there ſhould be no exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any: as if he ſhould haue ſaid. And therefore let no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brag of himſelfe, no not an inch, to be iuſt before God, &amp; to ouer ſlipt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> remedy wherof I eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now ſpake: for he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> perfecteſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:7663:119"/> iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of men, ſhalbe fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d guiltie before the maieſtie of god, We ſée héere then the meaning of the Prophet: howbeit he is not for al that, thus contented, but ſaith, <hi>That euery man is declined from his way.</hi> But why repeateth he the ſaying, of al, to euery one. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, I will tell you, becauſe, when as wee are generally condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, we are not ſo liuely moued and touched as we ought to be. In déede, this muſt néedes bée a plaine condemnation, whenas it is ſaide, that there is not amongſt the children of men, one iuſt man:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.2.</note> and is alſo ſaid, in another place of the Pſalmiſt, That God loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked downe from heauen, &amp; ſaw not one man that was not corrupt in his ſinnes. Hée ſpeaketh alſo there aſwell of the godly who were in great eſtimation and dignitie, as alſo of the wicked. It is ſaide that all men haue gone aſtray, and that there could not bée founde one who was not corrupt before the Lorde: and of this doctrine, the holy Scripture is full:<note place="margin">Rom. 3.9.</note> Saint Paul alſo ſheweth this very ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently in his Epiſtle to the Romans, whenas he bryngeth in the ſayinges of the Pſalmiſt and of the Prophets, where any thing is ſpoken of infamous men, ſaying, That there is nothing but malice and treaſon in them, full of crueltie, poyſon, violence, deceipt and robbery, and their throat an open Sepulchre. When all theſe thinges are ſpoken of, Saint Paule ſaith, that all men are heerein comprehended without exception, vntill ſuch time as GOD hath changed and renued them by his holy Spirite.</p>
               <p>Nowe, let this doctrine bée preached, and wée muſt néedes all ſtoupe and yéelde: for, ſhame and feare will not ſuffer vs to reply againſt our God. And to ſay the trueth, what ſhall wée get by our reaſoning and diſputing? For, wee muſt feele, in deſpite of our téethes, that wée are not condemned in vaine, ſince it is God that iudgeth vs. And yet notwithſtanding euery of vs wil return home to his houſe, and bee no whit moued thereat: and the thing that hath béene tolde vs will not touch vs at all. Wée will well enough agrée that wee are all ſinners, and that euery man is guiltie before the Lorde: But doe wée in the meane while féele the burden of our ſinnes, and be diſpleaſed with them, and beſides, are we ſtirred vp to ſéeke for the fauour of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, and deny our ſelues? No, no: and yet we think we are ſufficiently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, if wée ſay that wée are ſinners. And that which is worſe wée ſhall oftentimes ſée men bouldly couer and cloke their ſinnes
<pb facs="tcp:7663:120"/> when they are accuſed and conuinced of them. Ho good Syr, wyll they ſay, It is very true y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are ſinners. Surely, if a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> exhort a wicked blaſphemer of the name of God, or ſome ſuch one as hath committed a curſed and horrible déede, hee will deny it at the firſt chop: and neuer confes it but by conſtraint. But what if he ſee him ſelfe to be conuicted? In very déede Syr, will he the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay, we are all ſinners. And that is aſmuch to ſay, that thou art a wicked hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite that thus ſcorneſt God. Thus we ſée that vnder theſe general words, there are very many which wil finde out this excuſe, to the end they would not haue their filthineſſe knowne as it ought to be And for this cauſe, after the Prophet had ſaide, That all haue erred, he addeth, <hi>Euery one, euery one,</hi> as if he ſhould haue ſaide, looke not generall what mankinde is, but let euery man ſift him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a part, and conſider and way wel with your ſelues what you are. For, the way to cauſe vs to be touched with the iudgements of God, and to be brought to true humilitie is, whenas wee are brought to repent vs of our wickedneſſe, &amp; that euery man in this ſort ſhall as it were, haue ſecretely examined his owne conſcience. Thus we ſée the meaning of the Prophet. Moreouer, when hee ſaith, That euery man hath departed from his way, hee declareth in the firſt place that he ſpeaketh of thoſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who are gouerned by their luſtes, and according to their owne reaſon and wiſdome. And this is a point to be throughly marked of vs, becauſe we ſée the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſome to be ſuch, as that all the perſuaſions in the worlde can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not withdrawe them from running into deſtruction, by doing of that which ſéemeth beſt in their owne eyes: The other ſort, doe ſo beaſtly follow their deſires, as that they vnderſtand not that they plunge themſelues wittingly into the bottome of Hell, except god reſtrained them. For we ſée how the Papiſts at this day deale, whenas they are found fault with, by the word of God, &amp; are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced therby. I beſéech you ſir, wil they ſay, let me alone, for be as be may, I will be ſure to go on that courſe which I haue begunne. And wilt thou ſo? why then thou ſurely goeſt the direct way to hel: for this is thy way, if thou folow y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thy courſe. Ho, tuſh, why man, I haue ſuch a good deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is impoſſible for God to reiect it. Wel ſir, but the Prophet Iſaiah ſpeaketh alſo héere of the deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which euery man maketh to himſelf: &amp; thinkeſt thou that the holy ghoſt who ſpake in thoſe daies by his mouth, knew not that thou
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7663:120"/> wouldſt be an hypocrite, full of poyſon &amp; pride: that thou wouldeſt be ruled as thou luſteſt: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou wouldſt deuiſe a ſeruice of god at thy owne pleaſure: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou wouldſt worſhip idols, &amp; thinke thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt wel: &amp; that therein ſhould ſtand thy religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, hath the holy ghoſt vnderſtood all thy villanies? Then looke thou to that which he hath ſpoken, <hi>Euery man hath walked in his owne way,</hi> to wit, euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath gone the ſtraite way to hell. Euery man hath run into deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by taking his own courſe. Héere then we ſee what the waies are that we take. And ſo, we are taught by this place to caſt of all fond arrogancie, &amp; to vnderſtand, that when we doe that which ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth good in our own eies, &amp; which we think to be very reſonable, it is as if we had made a league w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Sata<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to catch vs in his ſnares. And therfore this doctrine ſerueth for the correction of all preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the end we might be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented to be ruled only by ſpirite of God, &amp; by his word: and let vs alſo in like maner obſerue, that the Prophet Iſaiah hath declared by theſe wordes, that although wee know the thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is good, yet wil we not leaue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doing the thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is wicked &amp; naught. And why ſo? Forſooth, becauſe al our affections are enimies to God: &amp; although we ſée that we muſt refuſe the euil yet wil we be carried away therwith, &amp; that not forcibly, but euen very wittingly wickedly, &amp; it is ſo hid in vs, as that the fruit muſt néedes ſhew what the rootes are. And therefore, let vs in the firſt place vnderſtand, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we know not how to walke a right, &amp; there is but one only way which God alloweth of, &amp; which wil bring vs to ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: to wit, whenas our Lord Ieſus ſhal take vs into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. &amp; be the ſhéepe of his flocke, &amp; follow him as our ſhepheard, let vs alſo further vnderſtand, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al the affections are corrupt, &amp; wil hunt after euill in ſtéede of good, vntil ſuch time as our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath corrected &amp; reformed vs, &amp; put into vs a right affection to obey him. And this is it which the Prophet meaneth to declare. Now, let vs conclude, that all ſuch as toſſe to &amp; fro, doe depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Lord Ieſus. For the Prophet ſaith, That all the Patriarkes &amp; Prophets &amp; euery one of the holy Fathers and Martyrs, haue née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be reconciled vnto God, through the death and Paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. For, if Abraham the father of the faithful, If Dauid the mirrour of al righteouſneſſe, and if others ſuch like, as Iob &amp; Daniell, who are called as it were, the myrrours of all holineſſe and perfection: If theſe, I ſay, were poore ſtrayed
<pb facs="tcp:7663:121"/> and loſt ſhéepe, vntill ſuch time as they were reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled by our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, Alas, what ſhall become of vs? And therefore when we ſhall ſéeke after our Mediators, and thinke by their meanes to eſcape the deſtruction wherein wée are, do wée not ſhew our ſelues too too vnthankefull vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt? And are not wée in the meane while too too voyde of ſenſe and reaſon, to craue any thing at their handes, who alſo haue néede to runne for help to the death and paſſion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt? For, if neceſſitie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth vs to ſéeke for remedie, we muſt goe vnto him, vnto whom all the faithfull in euery age had recourſe: For neither Saint Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor yet Saint Paul, ne the virgin Mary, nor any whatſoeuer, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are exempt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it. And therefore let vs learne to goe to the ſpring head and fountaine, and drawe cut of that which is wanting vnto vs. For our Lorde Ieſus hath wherewith to ſatiſfie vs all: and wée muſt not feare that the fulneſſe of his grace, can any way bée drawne dry: but bée aſſured, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he will giue to euery one his parte and portion thereof, which will come to ſéeke for it. Wherefore, let vs come vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, and he will ſatiſfie vs all: But whoſoeuer declineth from him either one way or other, ſuche a one cannot bée holpen with that remedie which is offered vnto him, but refuſeth it aſmuche as in him lyeth: ſo that his vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe is a let for the inioying of the grace that is preſented vnto him. And ſo much the more ſhall wée bée inexcuſable, ſince this is dayly preached vnto vs. For, God was not contented to haue ſent his Sonne for a time, to thruſt him out to bée ſlaine, and to beat him in his wrath, although hée loued him as his onely ſonne (for, notwithſtanding he woulde caſt him downe to the outward ſhew and vſed all the rigour that was poſſible againſt him, yet was hée alwayes his beſt beloued ſonne, as alredy hath béene ſaid: howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it all was to the end that we might bée pardoned) yet was hée not I ſay, contented with this: but dayly deliuereth vnto vs this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to the end wée might inioy it: hée declareth vnto vs that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte who was thruſt into the ſide, hath at this day his hart as it were wyde open, that wée might bée aſſured of the loue hee beareth vs, and that as his armes were tyed faſt to the croſſe, euen ſo hath he now ſtretched them out to imbraſe vs and pull vs vnto him: and woulde haue all theſe thinges to doe vs good: and as hée hath ſhed his blood, ſo would hée that wée ſhould at this day bée
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:7663:121"/> plunged therein. Wherefore, when God ſo neatly inuiteth vs, and that Ieſus Chriſt alſo ſéeth before vs the benefite of his death and paſſion, and telleth vs that his blood is alwayes freſhe (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſaying of the Apoſtle to the Hebrewes) that it is not like dry blood, which beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth nothing:<note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> but becauſe it is ſanctified by his heauenly power, therefore this blood is continually freſh: for the Apoſtle hath vſed this ſpéeche, that wee might vnderſtand, that his power is not leſſened, but hath continually his full and whole ſtrength, ſuch as it had from the beginning, to the end wée myght all come and ſubmit our ſelues vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſte. And after wée haue confeſſed our ſinnes, and be aſhamed of them, let vs not doubt, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is ſufficient to giue vs ſuch remedy, as that we may conclude that God hath receiued and allowed vs, as his own children, and accounteth vs as righteous and perfect, where before wée were abhominable in his ſight. Thus wée ſée what we haue to learne out of this doctrine. And becauſe we ſée that at this day ſome ieſt and mock, and other ſome waxe proude &amp; preſumptuous, and thinke by their righteouſneſſe to ſatiſfie God, let vs deny all ſuch blaſphemies, and in true faith and repentance ſéeke for our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, and with all our affections ſubmit our ſelues to him, whenas we ſhall féele our ſelues thus charged with ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable a burden.</p>
               <p>Let vs nowe fall downe before the Maieſtie of our good God, &amp; acknowledge our offences, beſéeching him to cauſe vs ſo to féele them, as that wée may grone for them all our life longe, and be moued to haue recourſe vnto him: and not to wander and roile in our fooliſh, wicked, and diueliſh opinions: But in vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that al our bleſſedneſſe, and whatſoeuer els belongeth to our ſaluation, is in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that it would pleaſe this our good God, to make vs come wholy vnto him, and ſo kéepe our faith, as that we neuer be turned away from it And that it would pleaſe him alſo, by his holy ſpirite ſo to worke in our heartes, that we knowing our ſelues to bee fréely forgiuen of our ſinnes, might alſo acknowledge, what a great pryce it coſt, and howe deare and precious it was vnto his onely Sonne, that thereby wée might bée ſo much the more ſtyrred vp to magnifie him. And foraſmuche as wee muſt bee healed by him, that it woulde pleaſe him to cleanſe vs dayly of all our faultes and ſinnes, vntyll ſuch time as hee hath
<pb facs="tcp:7663:122"/> brought vs vnto that perfection, wherunto wee ought to growe al our life long: that it would pleaſe him not onely to ſhew vs this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, but alſo vnto all people and nations of the earth, &amp;c.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the Prophet had ſhewed that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of vs was to looke into himſelfe and vnto his owne ſins, if we woulde receiue any benefite by the death and paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, hée now ſaith, that he ſuffered not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly, but willingly: for, if he had not done ſo, we ſhould neuer haue been iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, neither yet ſhoulde any attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment haue béen made betwéene God &amp; vs: to wit, if Ieſus had not repared our tranſgreſſions through his obedience. And therfore if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death of the ſonne of God had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, and that he had not ſubmitted himſelfe willingly, it had not béen a Sacrifice to haue blotted out our ſinnes:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.9.</note> for S. Paul al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo bringeth vs backe to this conſideration, whenas hee ſaith that our tranſgreſſions were taken away by the obedience of one man. What was the cauſe that made God become our enimie, and yet is, but, for that wée neuer leaue offending of him? Hée created
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:7663:122"/> vs that he might peaceably and quietlye enioy vs: but when wée refuſe to beare his yoke, he is of very right to deteſt vs, and not to allow vs for his creatures.</p>
               <p>We ſée then why it is ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our Lord Ieſus was not only chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for our ſins &amp; tranſgreſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but alſo, <hi>that he did not once open his mouth,</hi> nor yet gaue any foule language: but bicauſe he knew that he was appointed for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> purpoſe, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was the eternall decrée of god his father, he ſhewed himſelfe obedient euen vnto the death. And therfore when we would haue a more féeling of the power of the death &amp; paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſonne of god, let euery man conſider w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him ſelfe, how many ſundry wayes he hath withſtood the will &amp; iuſtice of God. Surely if we doo ſo, we ſhall finde that wee doo nothing els but make war againſt him, and as if we would willingly &amp; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly diſpite him. Wherfore we néede neuer be abaſhed, to haue the want of ſuch a remedy: to wit, that for the burying of the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of all our iniquities, the ſonne of GOD muſt obey in our behalfe.</p>
               <p>It is true indéede that our Lord Ieſus ſpake before Pylate his Iudge: but he dyd it not to eſcape death,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.3.</note> but rather offered himſelf vnto it: neither would he accept of any occaſion, to be pardoned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was very méete that he ſhould be condemned in our name. Wherfor it is not for naught that the Prophet ſaith, <hi>that hee was like a dumbe man:</hi> and compareth him vnto a <hi>ſheepe,</hi> or vnto <hi>A Lambe:</hi> hauing regarde vnto the figure of the auncient ſacrifices: for, when we héere the death and paſſion of our Lord Ieſus ſpoken of, we muſt take it to be a ſacrifice, wherwith God the father was appealed, becauſe that ſinnes (as we haue héertofore declared) could not be taken away, to pleaſe God, but by that meane. And to ſay the truth, whenas in the time of the law, men would craue pardon for their ſinnes, there muſt of neceſſitie be ſacrifices done. For they were neuer able to make any recompence: and therefore God tolde them, that it was ſufficient that they builded vpon the promiſe made vnto them in the redéemer. Wherefore, to the end the Iewes might vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that Ieſus Chriſt ſhould fulfil whatſoeuer was then figured in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law, this name of a lambe was namly giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him, and vnder one kinde, the Prophet hath comprehended all: as if he ſhould haue ſaide, that Ieſus Chriſt, in his death and paſſion, ſhould firſt take away all our iniquities, becauſe he ſhould ſubmit
<pb facs="tcp:7663:123"/> himſelfe vnto the will of God his father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and beſides, that in the ſecond place, he ſhould be ſacrificed as a Lamb, to the end that by the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his blood, all our ſpots ſhoulde be waſhed and made cleane. Wherefore, when we ſhall be rebuked for a great number of falts which we commit, and can neither will nor chuſe but féele y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrath of God, let vs haue recourſe vnto that which is héere ſet before vs. to wit, that it was not for nought that our Lorde Ieſus woulde not anſwer againe, although his afflictions were very extreame, and although God powred vpon him his whole rigour, yet dyd hée quietly ſuffer all, to the ende wee, by that his obedience might bée reconciled. And by the way, wee are alſo exhorted to faſhion our ſelues after his example: not that we are able, throughly &amp; perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly to humble our ſelues before GOD, but yet wee muſt ſtriue to doo it.</p>
               <p>This then, I ſay, that when it ſhall pleaſe his maieſty to make vs féele his moſt heauy hand, ſo that wée thinke that we are verye hardly dealt withall, yet let vs holde our peace, and confeſſe that God is iuſt, &amp; full of equitie, and not be hearde once to grudge: but rather gloryfie God by holding our peace, like miſerable ſinners, that are conuinced of their tranſgreſſions, and haue not a worde to ſay to the contrary.</p>

                     <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3.18.</note>Loe then how Saint Peter applieth this place: That is, that when wée are afflicted by the hand of God, yea and perſecuted by men, let vs paciently beare the iniuries done vnto vs, becauſe we know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is the mind of God to proue &amp; try vs, or rather to puniſh vs for our ſins: &amp; let vs beware we make no vaine excuſes as many men doo, who alledge their infirmitie and ouer great weakneſſe, ſo that they cannot be quiet, ſo long as GOD preſſeth them greuoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Howbeit wee muſt frame our ſelues like vnto the ſonne of God: for, he is our glaſſe and patterne, not that (as I haue ſaide) there is in vs the like power, but yet although wee cannot come néere him, let vs notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding ſtriue to come as néere him as we may.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 39.10.</note> Moreouer, we ſée that Dauid being a frayle man, as we are, did yet put in practiſe this doctrine: as he ſaith in one place, O Lord becauſe I knew y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was thy heauy hand that was vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I helde my peace. And in another place he ſaieth, ſince thou O Lorde haſt ſlaked the raynes of mine enimies, I haue pacientlye ſuffered the wronges and outrages that they haue done vnto mée.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7663:123"/> héere then we ſée what wee haue to learne out of theſe wordes: to wit, that as the Sonne of God was mute, becauſe hee would glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, and would not replye in all his afflictions; euen ſo lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe let vs ſuffer God to chaſtice vs when he thinketh good: or els to trie our obedience, in letting loſe the raines to the vngodlye, to perſecut vs.</p>
               <p>Now, it is impoſſible for vs to reache to it, vntill ſuch time as we be fully reſolued of this doctrine, that our Lorde by holding his peace both before God his father and alſo before men, hath repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all our ſinnes and iniquities. Moreouer, when we are tolde, that by the holding of his peace he purchaſed vs righteouſneſſe, we ſée that this ſilence, bred vs eftſoones this benefit, that hee did it to defende our cauſe, and is now become our mediator vnto God, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his mouth alwayes wide open: to witte, being euer ready to make interceſſion, for the helping of all the offences, whiche wee haue committed. For, in as much as he abode extreme perſecution, &amp; neuer gaue any words, he attained to this office, that if we be con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vinced in conſcience before God, and are to be condemned, for want of abilitie to ſay any thing for our excuſe, yet will hee defende vs, and God will alſo adiudge vs for innocentes, becauſe our ſinnes were thus repayred.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſée at what end we muſt begin, and then ſhal we haue greater courage, and be much better diſpoſed to kéepe our tonges, whenas we ſhall be any way afflicted by the hand of God. And héerevpon the Prophet ſaith, <hi>that he was lifted out of anguiſhe, or out of priſon</hi> (for the word importeth thus much) <hi>&amp; of iudgemet.</hi> There are ſome which expound it, as if Ieſus Chriſt had bene put to death by ſome ſodaine viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: but we are rather told that death ouercame him not, but was raiſed vp againe by the power of God his father.</p>
               <p>Now, it is not enough for vs that we vnderſtande, that our Lorde Ieſus hath ſuffered for our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and when we haue examined our life, we ſhal feele y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> without this help, we were al damned &amp; vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly loſt, &amp; if there were nothing els ſpoken of, but of the death and paſſion of the ſonne of God, we ſhould alwaies ſtande in doubt, for how can it be poſſible that we ſhould hope for life at his hands, ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he himſelf was hedlong caſt down into death? ſurely we ſhould neuer perceiue any diuine nor heauenly power, without the which
<pb facs="tcp:7663:124"/> wee can no way conceiue to put our truſt in him: becauſe wee ſhould ſée nothing but weakeneſſe, which would feare vs. And as the Prophet hath héeretofore ſpoken of the frute which we receiue by the death and paſſion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, euen ſo doth he now ſay, that it is becauſe he ſhall be lyfted vp by the power of god his father, <hi>he was lifted vp</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>out of anguiſh and iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</hi> And although he was condemned yet did not God leaue puttinge to his helping hand, but exalted him, that hee might haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chiefe dominion, and rule ouer all creatures.</p>

                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>4.</note>This is it which S. Paul ſetteth foorth in the Epiſtle to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, where he ſaith, that he ſhewed himſelfe to be the ſon of god by his riſing againe. For if we doo but only looke into the lyfe of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, as he liued héere amongſt men, and alſo into his death, we ſhould neuer finde that in him, which is requiſit for our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In very déede, the miracles which he dyd, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctrine which he preached, and the reſt of the ſignes which he ſhewed, was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to declare him to be the ſon of god, without our faith were to to weake. And yet ſhould we remaine alwaies in ſhame and doubt to ſée Ieſus Chriſt offer himſelfe, as a common and contemptible man: and beſides, it woulde make vs more aſhamed and gréeued, whenas we ſhould ſée him in the ende ſubiect to ſo curſed &amp; ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a death. But when we paſſe from his death, vnto his reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then we know, that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt got the victory for vs. And to the ſame purpoſe is that ſaying of S. Paul to the Corin. that although hée was crucified in weakneſſe,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4.</note> yet roſe hée againe by the power of God his Father. So then, the order which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet héere kéepeth, tendeth to the ſame ende, that we ſhoulde not ſtand in doubt, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our Lord Ieſus Chriſt had life in his hand, and was Lord &amp; maiſter therof. becauſe it was ſéene in his owne perſon. And therefore let vs vnderſtande, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſonne of God was made of no reputation for our ſakes: bicauſe wee know eftſoones, that he was not ſpoyled of his power: and although he kept it cloſe for a time, yet haue we ſuch a ſure teſtimonie thereof in his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, as that we ſhall not néede to make any excuſe, but fully and wholy beléeue in him: and bouldly ſet our ſelues againſt hel, &amp; ſin: ſéeing Ieſus Chriſt hath triumphed ouer them, and the hande of God ſuſtained him to be exempt of all anguiſhes: and was exalted by himſelfe to be God his Fathers lieutennaunt: &amp; (as I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid) to haue the chiefeſt gouernment in the worlde. This
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7663:124"/> then is the effect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which wee are to learne, whenas it is ſaide. <hi>that he was lifted from out of priſon, &amp; iudgement.</hi> Now, it muſt néedes fal out, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our Lord Ieſus ſhould diſcend into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bottomleſſe depthes, before ſuch time as he ſhould be exalted into the glory of heauen: for if he had appeared onely in maieſtie, how is it poſſible for vs at this day to bee aſſured, that our ſinnes are forgiuen vs. Surely, wée might ſée the ſonne of God the fountaine of lyfe, but wée ſhould ſée him as one deuided from vs, and wée ſhould haue nothing that is common to him, nor yet once come néere him.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, wée ſhould haue alwaies matter enough to diſpaire on, becauſe we are guilty of an infinit number of ſinnes And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt had gone downe into the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe depthes and had not bene afterwarde exalted into heauen, what had wée ben the better? truly, no whit, but alwayes remaine lyke miſerable caytiues, out of all meaſure diſquieted, and horry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly tormented, by ſéeing the wrath of God continuallye vpon vs. But when it is ſaide in the firſt place, that he was condemned, and ſuffered moſt fearefull panges, to the ende we might be freed from them, and be at peace with God (as yeſterday was tolde you) wée now know, that he loueth and fauoureth vs, &amp; receiueth vs to mer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cy: and therefore when we vnderſtande that Ieſus Chriſte was therevpon exalted: wée may alſo very well conclude that it was to draw vs vnto him, to the ende we might be partakers of the glory which was giuen vnto him by God his father.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, we are alſo to note the wordes of the Prophet which followeth, <hi>Who is he that is able to number his yeares.</hi> For, by theſe wordes he meaneth to ſhew, that the effect and power of the reſurrection of our Lord Ieſus was for euer, and that it is no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral thing which many times melteth and vaniſheth away. And this is a very neceſſary point: for, ſome haue taken this age, for the eternall generation of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by God his father from all eternitie. Some other haue ſtrayned the woordes of the Prophet this way and that: but when we ſhall looke more narrowly into the matter, there is no doubt, but that he meant to ſhewe, that the honour which was giuen to Ieſus Chriſt, was not for him ſelfe, and his owne perſon, and for a day onely, but that he purchaſed vs euerlaſting life, for as Saint Paule ſayeth, That inaſmuch as he dyed, he dyed once for ſinne,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.10.</note> But in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he now liueth, he liueth vnto God, &amp; ſhal neuer die again.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7663:125"/>
               <p>By this he declareth, that the ſacrifice whiche our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt offered, is ſufficient for vs, becauſe hee hath moſt perfectlye ſanctified vs by that meane. And therefore it was not néedefull that the Sonne of God ſhould ſuffer any more then once:<note place="margin">Heb. <hi>7.</hi>27.</note> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this power was in him, to blot out all our iniquities at once, let vs bouldly runne vnto his death and paſſion, and not doubt but that it wil alwayes haue this ſtrength in it, as to reconcile vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</p>
               <p>Now, the life wherinto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt entred, is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly: for it was ſuch a perfect condition, as could not be amended. And when S. Paul ſaieth, that he liueth vnto God, it is as muche as that he is now cleane exempt from all our miſeries, and from the condition that hée had before taken, which was to become a mortall man. Wherefore, Ieſus Chriſt hath diſcharged al this geare, and is now rid of all humaine fraileneſſe, to the end that we which are his members, might hope for the like in our ſelues. And ſo let vs in the firſt place note, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Prophet hath héere declared, that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt roſe not agayne, to bée any more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to death, but hath purchaſed euerlaſting life. In the 2 place we haue to learne, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this was not done onely for himſelfe, but alſo for all his whole Church. For, when it ſaid by the Pſalmiſt, that God was exalted, and tooke the ſpoyle of his enemies: this is to ſhewe, that when our Lord Ieſus chriſt was lifted vp after his death, that it all turned to the common benefit &amp; welfare of his Churche.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.19.</note> The ouercomming then of Satan and of ſinne, was to this end, that we might be deliuered of them, and enioy the fruit of ſuch a conqueſt, and therein triumph. This then is the very effect of that whiche we haue to learne out of this place. Now, the whole ſubſtance of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matter is this, that wée might vnderſtand, how to apply it rightly vnto our owne vſe. And therfore, when it is ſaide, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſon of God was, <hi>lifted vp from out of anguiſh &amp; condemnation,</hi> let vs learn, that when we are moued to become deſperat, to ſet Ieſus Chriſte before our eies, ſince we know that he hath paſſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> courſe: &amp; that God his father ſtretched out his hand vnto him, that he might not be oppreſſed, all which was done for our ſakes. Wherfore, we haue a very good way to come out of our anguſhes and paines, ſo long as we haue Ieſus Chriſt for our Captaine, and follow his ſteps, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whatſoeuer was accompliſhed in him, as being our heade,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:7663:125"/> belongeth to vs, and the effect thereof will appeare in euery faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man. And when <hi>his age</hi> is ſpoken off, it is to this end, that we might vnderſtande, that hee will bee of power able to defende his Church euen vnto the ende: for he will not be deuided from his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. In very déede, our eſtate and condition differeth greatly from his, vntill ſuch time as wée be taken out of this world: but in that he is the firſt borne of the dead, he is alſo the firſt fruits of all thoſe which ſhall riſe againe. Let vs then vnderſtande,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.20. <hi>Coll. 1.</hi>18.</note> that becauſe the Sonne of God, is not onely in his owne eſſence or being, and in his deuine maieſtie immortall, but alſo in his fleſh, and humaine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it is to this end, that his church might be alwaies preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in this world, &amp; neuer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ecay. True it is, we ſhal ſée great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and indéede a man would think many times, that the church of God, ſhould vtterly periſh: for, if there ariſe neuer ſo ſmall a tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peſt, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſurges will by and by, be ſo mightie &amp; horrible, as that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would ſay, all were loſt, &amp; cleane daſht. And this is ſo common a thing as may be. For, what outwarde ſhew of maintenaunce can there be to the church of God, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>as it is aſſailed thus on al hands? muſt it not néedes be thought, that it cannot be but vtterlye ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, whenas it is thus wonderfully aſſaulted? howbeit, this is the truth of it, we muſt be faine to reſort to our head. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſince the age of our Lord Ieſus is without end, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all the changes in the world cannot ſtay him from hauing a very good eye vnto his church, although the temptations were farre greater, and more violent then they are, yet let not vs ſhrink at the matter. And this is not to be applied only to the whole company of the faithful, but alſo to euery one of vs. And therefore let vs vnderſtand and be throughly perſwaded, that although our Lyfe be but a blaſt, &amp; we ready euery minute to vaniſh away, yet notwithſtanding that we haue a lyfe which laſteth for euer, becauſe we are the members of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. Moreouer, let vs eftſoones learne, to walk through this world, ſince this is not our life, which we héere preſently enioy, but a pilgrimage which we muſt paſſe on quickly, vntil ſuch time as we haue come vnto our quiet enheritance. Thus we ſée, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in hoping for euerlaſting life, wee muſt forſake all this, which is but a ſhadow: &amp; not ſuffer our ſences to be e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>folded in that which we openly ſée, and may occaſion vs to tarry ſtil héere in this world: for ſurely, as many as haue their mindes ſet héere on this
<pb facs="tcp:7663:126"/> lyfe, without doubt doo thereby ſeperate themſelues from the ſonne of God, and are vnworthy to haue any part or portion with him in his euerlaſting kingdome. And therfore, let vs forſake this world, if we wil ioyne our ſelues vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſon of god. Furthermore, becauſe this doctrine might take y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better holde of vs, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophet cryeth out he ſaieth not that the age of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſhall be onelye euerlaſting, but caſteth it out as a man meruelouſly abaſhed, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Who ſhall be able to number his yeares.</hi> Wherfore we are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed to ſtriue againſt all temptations: &amp; although we be ſome times hindred this way and that: &amp; be as it were caſt downe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out mouing, yet let vs reſiſt, &amp; with much to doo enforce vs, vntill ſuch time as wée haue attained vnto this which is héere ſhewed vs: to wit, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mans reaſon is not able to vnderſtande, nor yet any mouth able to expreſſe the age of our Lord Ieſus. And for the bringing of this matter about we muſt be alſo very wel aduertiſed to ſurmou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t all our thoughts, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>as we fal in reaſoning of putting our truſt in our lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; folow him, for the partaking of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enheritaunce, which he hath purchaſed for vs. Neither muſt we ſtick to our own opinion and fantaſy, whenas this doctrine ſhal be well treated of, as if it were to bée debated by words. But let vs know this, that although our faith hangeth vpon hearing, yet ſhall it neuer haue through aſſurance, except it receiue ſuch a teſtimony from God and from his holy ſpirite, as ſurpaſſeth whatſoeuer the tong of man is able to expreſſe. For this cauſe, muſt wée not dwell in our owne vnderſtandinges, and iudge as we thinke beſt, but let vs know that it is a wonderfull and an in comprehenſible ſecret, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the ſonne of God became a mortall man, and ſubiect to death, that wée might be exempt from it, and that now, in the middeſt of al our weaknes, we ſhould haue neuertheles life euerlaſting which muſt be obtained by fayth, vntil ſuch time as it be throughly manifeſted vnto vs at his comming, in the laſt day. And this is the effect of that which wée are to learne out of this place. Now the Prophet goeth on further, and ſaieth, <hi>That hee was cut of from out of the lande of the liuing, &amp; receued the wounds which were due to his people.</hi> This is a confirmation of that which wée lately handeled: to wyt, that the age of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt ſhould not ſerue for himſelf alone, but alſo for the whole body of his Church, wherevnto hee is vnited, and bounde as it were with an inſeperable bonde. For the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7663:126"/> Prophet ſheweth, that without it, it might be ſaide that the death and paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſhould be vnprofitable. Now this were a blaſphemie not to be borne, to think that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſon of God came downe into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, to abide ſo cruel a death, and to haue the iudgement of God fall ſo on his head, as that he beare the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for our ſinnes, and was taken to bee the greateſt malefactor in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world: &amp; yet al this not to profit his faithful ſeruants ani thing at all, yt might well inough be ſaide, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this were, as a man would ſay, a very ieſt. Wherfore, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophet bringeth vs back to this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhould well vnderſtand, for what end &amp; purpoſe our Lord Ieſus was thus ſcourged &amp; beaten. And this came not by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, as hath ben before declared. Nether muſt wée looke only vnto that which men did, and to thoſe which vniuſtly ſlew him, but wée muſt lift vp the eies of our faith vnto the counſell of God, by which he had ordained y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ieſus Chriſt ſhould be ſacrificed, to the ende hée might purchaſe remiſſion of our ſinnes for vs. Wherefore, ſince it is ſo, we are alwaies to conclude, that Ieſus Chriſt ſuffered not for himſelfe, but receyued the woundes which were due to vs, we are héere in this firſt place exhorted to enter into the knowledge and ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>amination of our ſins, whenas the death &amp; paſſion of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is ſet before vs. It is very true y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God therein powreth out the infinit treaſures of his goodnes: for, indéede, when S. Paul hath ſaide that we ar iuſtified by our lord Ieſus, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> in ſtaying our ſelues vpon his death &amp; paſſion, we may boldly preſent our ſelues before god, &amp; be glad that hée wil alwaies except of vs. After Saint Paul, I ſay, hath handled this doctrin, that although we be miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſinners, yet wil not God caſt vs off, but vpholde vs, becauſe hée receiueth vs in the name of his only ſon, he goeth on farther, &amp; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, I beſéech you Brethren euen in the bowels of the goodnes and mercie of God. Wherin he ſheweth, that in the ſuffering of Ieſus Chriſt, we haue a teſtimony of the infinit loue of god: as if he wold lay open his hart, and ſhew vs his bowels to teſtefye vnto vs how deare and precious wée and our ſoules are vnto him.</p>
               <p>Howbeit this is not ſett downe, to the ende wée ſhoulde ſléepe and take pleaſure in our ſins: For the more that God ſheweth himſelf lyberal in the perſon of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, ſo much the more ought wee to féele, what a gréeuous thing it is for vs to become
<pb facs="tcp:7663:127"/> his enemies, and fight againſt his iuſtice, and cauſe him to ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt vs: for, the grace which God ſheweth vs in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, ought to draw vs continually to repentaunce. Now, the papiſtes at this day, go about falſely to accuſe vs of the doctrine which we preach, which is this, that we muſt be ſaued by the frée mercy of God, haue our whole recourſe vnto Ieſus Chriſt, bicauſe we knowe that therein wee haue all our perfection of rightuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. Now forſooth Sir, ſay they, you haue made a great ſpeake, for, then euery man may liue as he luſt, and they néede neuer care any more for the offending of God.</p>
               <p>Indéed, theſe dogs may bark thus, becauſe they neuer knew what it is to taſt of the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes. For theſe hipocrites make a ſkorne at God, and at all religion, and haue neuer learned, what it is to tranſgres the law of God. And wee alſo ſée, how iollily they thinke themſelues diſcharged, if they haue once ſong a Maſſe, blea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and maſked, and they think that God is as well pleaſed with this, as a young Child is pleaſed with a pudding.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſée how theſe ſkorners of God, can blaſpheme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpell, but when we haue come once to the acknowledgment of our ſins, and know to what ende the ineſtimable grace of God is preached vnto vs, without doubt wée ſhoulde bee touched with repentance, and be mortally wounded with the horror of anguiſhe and payne, when wée ſée God to bee our enimie, becauſe wée haue prouoked him to wrath. And this is héere the meaning of the prophet, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath ſuſtained y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wonds which were due to vs. Wherin he ſheweth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we can neuer liuely féele, what good the death and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath done vs, except we be inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly throughly touched with the offending of our God, wherby wee haue made him to become as our Iudge &amp; enemy, vntill ſuch time as we be reconciled vnto him by his méere goodneſſe and mercy.</p>
               <p>Now, this is ſufficiently declared to vs in the holy Scripture: but héerein reſteth the whole matter, that wée applye our witte and ſtudie thereto.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 11.28</note> Neuertheleſſe, be as be may, we ſée that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt calleth none but ſuch as doo labor, and are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy laden.</p>
               <p>By this he excludeth all ſuch as ſléepe in their iniquities, and flatter them ſelues in them, or els which giue them ſelues to al ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenciouſneſſe, without any feare of God. And therefore, they which
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7663:127"/> are thus giuen ouer to all wickedneſſe, cannot poſſibly come néere vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, for who ſhall giue vs an entraunce vnto him, but the voyce whiche calleth vs? Euen ſo fareth it with them, who are ſo proude and preſumptiouſlye blinde, as that they make them ſelues beléeue that they are righteous through their owne deſerts, and ſurely, he ſhutteth the gate againſt all ſuch kind of people, ſo that they can haue no hope that our Lord Ieſus chriſt bringeth them any comfort or ſolace. And why ſo? forſooth, becauſe he thus ſaith, come vnto mée, who are they? All the world. Indéed, this is true that he calleth all the worlde, howbeit hee maketh a diſtinction of it, for thus he ſaithe, all yée that labor and are heauy loden. For, after he had called all ſuch as had néede of his helpe, hée ſheweth that none can be partakers thereof but ſuch as doo la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor and are heauy loden.</p>
               <p>And therfore, when we ſhall féele our burden, and ſo groane vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, as that we are able to beare no more, ſée what a way is laide open vnto vs, to come vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe he hath ſtretched out his armes to imbrace vs. For, we ſhall ſée héerafter, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hée was ſent vnto thoſe whoſe hartes were abaſed and caſt downe. Wherfore, wée muſt bée ſacrificed after this maner, that wée might bée made like vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In very déede, the ſacrifice which he offered, is our full hope and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuraunce: to wit, we muſt not preſume to adde any thing vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: becauſe he hath purchaſed ful ſaluation, by his ſacrificing of him ſelfe vnto God his father: but by the way, it is méete that wée ſhoulde be threatned by the iudgements of God, to the ende we might vnderſtand, how gréeuos a thing it is, that wée béeing poore wormes of the earth, ſhould lift our ſelues vp againſt the maieſtie of our creator, and violate his iuſtice, conſidering that we are placed héere in this world to ſerue and honor him. And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore let vs haue a liuely féeling of this, that wee might come vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now it ſhould ſéeme héere at the firſt ſight that the Prophet had ſet downe a ſtraunge reaſon, when hée ſaith, <hi>bicauſe hee was cut of from the lande of the liuing.</hi> For, in aſmuch as Ieſus Chriſt was exalted, and hath now the rule both in heauen and in earth, it ſhuld ſéeme y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this was no fit meane, without he had firſt bene as one cut of: For this glory, wherein now he is, he alwayes had,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17.5.</note> before the world was made according to the ſaying of S. Iohn. And therfore
<pb facs="tcp:7663:128"/> Ieſus Chriſt as touching his deuine eſſence or being, obtained vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe no ſtraunge thing.</p>
               <p>Now, to bee caſt downe into the bottomleſſe pitte of death as it were, was not the way to come vnto heauenly glory: and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by a mortall man, is not like that he ſhould be made iudge of the whole worlde. Howbeit, the meaning of God was ſuch, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he would worke beyond mans reaſon: neither muſt wée bring our counſell hether with vs, and think that wée are able to amend this counſel, which wée know, to be the cauſe and ſpringhead of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: but let vs moſt humbly gloryfy God, becauſe hee woulde haue his ſonne to be thus cut off from the lande of the liuing. Now the Prophet namely ſpeaketh after this manner, as though Ieſus Chriſt had bene vtterly aboliſhed: and would not make mention onely of a common death, but euen of ſuch a death as ſhould vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly root him out, as if the remembrance of him had bene cléerelye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed and defaced. For although of neceſſitie, all men muſt dye, &amp; thereby are cut of from the land of the lyuing, yet hath this ben ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſéene in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that his death was to haue ſhut him quite out from the company of men. For (as we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid) it was a moſt ſhamefull death, and curſſed of God: and beſides, it was almoſt euen the very gulfe of hell: yet not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ieſus chriſt was ſwalowed vp of it: howbeit he ſtraue mightely againſt the anguſhes of death. And therefore it is not for naught that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſetteth him downe héere as one that had ben aboliſhed from a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Neuertheles how euer it is he obtained by this menes ſuch maieſtie in this nature of ours, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> at this day he being our brother,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.8.</note> yet ceaſeth not alſo to become our iudge. And marke what S. Paul ſaith of it, that he rendred himſelf obedient vnto death, yea euen to the moſt curſſed death of the Croſſe, in ſaying that he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred himſelfe obedient, he noteth vnto vs that which wee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared out of the prophet, to wit, that, that which our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſuffered, was willingly done. But becauſe wee are guilty before god, &amp; are his enemies, it is ſaide y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ieſus Chriſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf: for as S. Paul ſaith, he who had all power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, tooke vpon him the forme of a ſeruant, &amp; the ſtate of thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yoke. Thus we ſée how obedient he was all his lyfe long, &amp; would be vnder the law. And not only in this, but although he felt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> horrible panges of death, which made him ſweat water &amp;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7663:128"/> blood, &amp; draue him to ſay, O father, if it be poſſible, I beſéech thée,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.36</note> let this ſo ſower a cup paſſe ouer mée: neuertheles he reſtraineth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe &amp; ſaith: yet not my will, but thine be done. Now herevpon S. Paul ſaith y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God his father, for this cauſe, exalted him, &amp; gaue him a name aboue all other names, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euery knée at this day might bow vnto. Wherfore, let vs vnderſtand that Ieſus Chriſt himſelf, hath euen in our nature, an excellent maieſtie, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end we might come to him in full aſſurance: for, vpon what condition is he made iudge ouer all the world? forſooth, it is becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is not onely made our Brother, but alſo for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he offred himſelf to be our pledge &amp; borrow and hath borne al our ſins. He was ſcourged &amp; beaten by the hand of god, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we might be healed of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wounds which we deſerued to haue and for this cauſe is he now exalted, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende we might bouldlye draw néere vnto him. Now this is very true, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the wicked ones, &amp; the deuils, muſt in deſpite of their téethes, féele that the ſon of God is far aboue them, for he muſt tread all his enemies vnder his féet.<note place="margin">

               <p>And this is a thing that ſhould greatly touch vs: for in the firſt place we are admoniſhed, that although we are not able at the firſt chop to haue the ſound vnderſtanding of the doctrine of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and what fruit we gather out of that which is dayly preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto vs, yet muſt we not diſpaire for all that, but ſearch out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scripture that thing which we know not, and then, God hauinge pittie on vs, will giue vs his hand, and ſet vs in the right way.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Prophet continueth héere the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine before ſpecified: to witte, that there was ſuch inimity betwéene God and vs, as that the wrath of God could by no meanes be appeaſed, but by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt his anſwering of the ſame, euen to the vttermoſt. For, by how much the more the ſuffering of the ſon of god was, by ſomuch y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more mai we gather, how greeuous our ſinnes are, and how wonderfully God abhorreth them: conſidering (as wee haue héeretofore ſaide, and as héereafter ſhall be more at large ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) that there is no ſuperfluous nor vnprofitable thing in the death and paſſion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. And therefore, for ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he was terribly tormented, hee hath on the one ſide wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed vnto vs his infinite goodneſſe and loue, and we, on the other ſide are to looke what it is that our iniquities haue deſerued before the maieſtie of our good God.</p>
               <p>Now, it is heere ſayde, that ouer and beſides that, which hath
<pb facs="tcp:7663:130"/> beene alreadie recited, that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was put to be ſkorned and ſhamed of the vngodly, that they might euen glory and triumph ouer him: for there is no doubt, but that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet by this word <hi>Graue,</hi> ment to expreſſe, that Ieſus Chriſt was ſubiect to all rebuke and ſhame, and that God woulde forſake him as it were for a ſeaſon, to the end the worlde might make no reckoning of him: accordingly as it is ſet downe vnto vs in the Goſpell. For they did not onely crucifie Ieſus Chriſt, but they alſo put out their tongues at him: rayling and ſcoffing, and as much as in them lay, went about to make him deſperate. Which thing was very well foretolde by the Pſalmiſt, to witte, that the moſt wicked and vngodly, ſhould put out their tongues at him. For this was the ſpeech they had, he hath ſaued others, ſay they and therefore let him now ſaue him ſelfe if he can. Why calleth not hee vpon his God?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.42.</note> we ſhall ſee whether hee ſo greatly loueth him or no. We ſee then how the wicked wounded our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and how furiouſly men outraged againſt him: and it was to this end and purpoſe, that we might finde ſo much fauour at the handes of God, as to haue our ſinnes couered: and although Satan hath wherefore to accuſe vs, yet ſhall all the ſhame wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto he is any way able to put vs, be clearely buried. Wherefore ſince our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt would néeds beare all our blame and ſhame, it was to this ende that all our filthineſſe might be couered before the Lord our God, ſo that they ſhould neuer be able to come in minde any more.</p>
               <p>And when the prophet ſpeaketh héere <hi>of the Riche,</hi> it is as much as if he had ſaide, the moſt outragious kind of people. For we know, that when men are riche and in authoritie, they goe about to make them ſelues to bée feared, alwayes abuſing their power and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. And this alſo we ſée, that very few or none of theſe men kepe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny temperatneſſe and meaſure, either yet become gentle and mild, when they may hurt. But as for the poore ſoules, although indéede they are fearce and cruel enough, yet are they kept backe from doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any harme, euen by maine force, &amp; thereby the miſchief which they would gladly doe, is not ſeene. Howbeit as for the rich and mightie ones, they are without all order, and thinke whatſoeuer they doe is lawfull. To be ſhort, the Prophet his meaning is, that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt was thruſt into the hands of men, to the end he might be ſo vilainouſly handled, as that he was not woorthie to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7663:130"/> be accounted amongeſt the contemptible &amp; petie companions: but to be taken as a worme of the earth, and to haue all the mocks and ſkornes that might be, to be laid vpon him. Thus we ſée the ſumm and effect of this firſt part. Now, he by and by after ſayth, <hi>That he had for all this done no wickednes,</hi> whereby he ment to ſhew, that that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſon of God, as touching himſelfe being innocent, would take vpon him all our burdens, wherewith we were ouercharged: for there was no mortall creature that was able to beare and ſuffer that which our Lord Ieſus Chriſt dyd. And ſo by that meane, the prophet againe declareth vnto vs, that it was not for his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, neither yet was he guiltie of any thing whenas they thus cruelly and tirrannouſly vſed him: but abod all this geare for our ſakes. And to ſay the truth, if we looke well into the life of our Lord Ieſus,<note place="margin">

For this were a very bare kinde of ſpeach to ſay, loe I beſéeche you, hée was guilty in nothing, but ſo behaued himſelf, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world was to loue &amp; honor him. Al this is true indéed, howbeit, this were ouer cold a kind of doctrin to be taught, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our lord Ieſus had néede to be excuſed, &amp; exempt, from all blame. And therefore the prophet had a farder conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him: &amp; ioineth theſe 2 points together which are héere ſet downe: to wit, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> god had put his only ſon to al horrible rebuke &amp; ſhame, &amp; yet was innocent &amp; guiltles. Now, if men ſhould lift vp the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues againſt him, &amp; it not done by the prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of god, it might be ſaid y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were furiouſly be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; yet knew not any cauſe why: neuertheles, it is ſaid y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was done by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hande of God. For, although the prieſtes, and all the Iewes in general &amp; the
<pb facs="tcp:7663:131"/> Souldiers, were ſtirred vp by the Deuill, to vomit out theſe blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, which we read of in the Goſpell, againſt our Lord Ieſus, yet, Iſaiah ſaith, that they had neuer bin able to haue done it, with out the appointment of the Lorde, and therefore we muſt not fixe our eyes onely vpon men, to ſay, that this or that they haue done: but it is as if God had ſet him ſelfe downe in his iudgment ſeat, to haue fully determined to ſende his onely ſonne into the handes of ſuch wicked and cruell tirauntes, as that no ſhame and villanye that was poſſibly to be deuiſed ſhould not light vpon him. And therfore, when it is not onely ſaid that men, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God his father alſo ſpared him not:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3 16.</note> who gaue him to death for our redemption (whereof Saint Iohn alſo ſpeaketh, that God ſo loued the world, as that hée woulde ſhewe it in the perſon of his Sonne, becauſe he gaue him ouer to ſo bitter a death for vs) if we ſo lift vp our eyes, as to acknowledge that nothing came vnto the perſon of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, but by the determination of God, we muſt conclude, that ſince Ieſus Chriſt was innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (as indéede he was) that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, manifeſtly appeared, our ſinnes and iniquities, ſo that all the ſhames and reproches which lighted vpon him, ſhoulde haue bene vpon vs. And therfore let vs vnderſtande, that it is méete that all the Creatures in the worlde ſhoulde arme them ſelues to crye for vengeaunce vpon vs: yea and although they haue neither mouthe nor tongue, yet might they be there ſo, to diſcouer all our ſhames and vices, as that both heauen and earthe might bee aſhamed of vs.</p>
               <p>Wée ſée now what we are to conſider of in this firſt place: For either God muſt at pleaſure haue thus afflicted his onely ſonne, or els haue ſhewed vs what we deſerued for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greeuoſnes of our ſins: to wit, that wee are blame worthie of al handes. In very deede wee cannot a way with the leaſt puniſhment that may be: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, we are ſo effeminate and impacient, as that if our credit bée touched, we will eftſoones, wonderfully ſtorme: and all this is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we know not what we are, neither iudge wée whether wée bée rightfully or wrongfully blamed.</p>
               <p>Wherfore, let vs well conſider, that although the rebuke and ſhame which we deſerue, are aboliſhed in the perſon of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, yet is it méete that God ſhould moue and ſtirre vs to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7663:131"/> repentance: &amp; although we would not by our willes enter into the tryall and examination of our ſhame, yet rayſeth hée vp men to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake vs: and the more that wée woulde goe about to hyde our faultes by vaine excuſes, the more layeth hée our ſhame open before vs, to the ende it might bée knowne, Saint Paule amongſt the fruites of repentance, ſetteth downe this,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.25 <hi>2. Cor.</hi> 7.11.</note> That when we think of our wicked life paſt, wée ſhoulde cloſe our eyes, grone before the Lord God, and be aſhamed of our ſelues. But what is he that doth it ſo perfectly, as it ought to bée done. Nay we rather ſéeke after an hipocritical maner to forget our ſinnes and iniquities: and GOD meaneth to remember vs and to call vs to an account, whenas he ſéeth vs ſo ſleightly and cunningly hide them. But by the way, let vs conſider, that wee may now preſent our ſelues before God and his Angels, and be aſſured that our ſinnes ſhall not bée layde vnto our charge, neither yet our vncleanneſſe bée diſcouered, and that becauſe our Lorde Ieſus hath borne ſuch blame: neither was this by chaunce as wée commonly ſay, neither yet did men falſely take this matter vpon them againſt him, without the good will and pleaſure of God: But becauſe God had thus eſtabliſhed the matter by his heauenly iudgement. Nowe forſomuche as our Lorde Ieſus was iuſt and righteous, it was alſo very méete that hée ſhould beare our burden vpon him, being in this ſort afflicted. And therefore, let vs in the firſt place vnderſtand, that we deſerue to haue all rebuke and ſhame to bee laide vpon vs: and yet for all this, that wée are pardoned of the ſame, becauſe he hath diſcharged vs thereof, and hath made ſatiſfaction for it in his owne perſon. Thus wée ſée why, and to what purpoſe the innocencie and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Sonne of God is héere ſpoken of. For it is not ſet downe to the ende to excuſe him, but for this cauſe, that we might féele what wee are, and whether we muſt néedes be brought, except we were redéemed and bought from it.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the Prophet meaning to expreſſe ſuch a full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as coulde not be amended, ſayth, <hi>That there was no deceite founde in his mouth.</hi> Nowe Saint Iames ſaith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iames.</hi> 3.2.</note> That he muſt needes be a very perfect man, out of whoſe mouth eſcapeth not an ill word, becauſe the tongue is the weakeſt thing that maybe. And although we be too too much inclined to al kind of wickednes, yet,
<pb facs="tcp:7663:132"/> that man that can refrain his handes and féet, and in ſuch ſort lead the whole courſe of this life, as that he is ſéene to liue vertuouſly &amp; in the feare of God, yet is hée neuer able to refraine his tongue, but that there wyll appeare ſome light, inconſiderate, lying or diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſpéeche in him. To bée ſhort, it is ſaide that there was no deceite to bée founde in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, to ſhewe, that in all his wordes and deedes, hée was a myrrour of all holineſſe.</p>
               <p>Nowe, it is moſt certaine that all the miſeries which we féele are the very fruites of our ſinnes. For, had we aboade in the ſame puritie wherein God ſet our father Adam, our puniſhments ſhould ceaſe and bée aboliſhed in the worlde. And therefore the fruit of our ſinnes is the cauſe of our puniſhments. So then, wée are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that forſomuch as there was not found the leaſt blot that might bée in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, he therefore beare the puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhment, which we were worthie of, and deſerued. And marke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, why the Prophet addeth, that God <hi>woulde make him ſubiect to infirmities.</hi> This worde <hi>Infirmitie,</hi> hath a large ſcope in the Scriptures, for it importeth all the thinges which make men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, as wée ſée in many places thereof. For, pouertie, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, griefe of minde, or contemptibleneſſe, and a man that hath no good grace either to ſpeake or do well, neyther yet good geſture or behauiour, nor habiltie of wit and diſcretion, are al called in the Scripture infirmities. To bée ſhorte, this is to bryng vs backe to the thing which the Prophet hath already touched: to wit, that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte was like a deformed Creature, and ſuche a one as in whom was no ſhew of reputation and credit amongſt men. And yet not ſuch a one neither, but that there appeared in him, ſure and certaine markes and toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, that he was to bée hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as the onely Sonne of God:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.14.</note> But it was in ſuch ſorte darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his ſufferings, and his infirmitie ſuch, as that there was no power or vertue ſéene in him, and it ſéemed that there was no grace nor fauour in hym why hée ſhoulde bée eſtéemed and had in honour. Wée muſt alſo call to minde the thing that hath béene before recited, to wit, that he was beaten and ſcourged by the hand of God, ſuffered the horrible anguiſhes of his iudgement, &amp; in his body beare the fearefulleſt torments that might be: and ouer and beſides all this, he was ſo vily thought of, as that he was not eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to bée placed amongſt the moſt wicked and ſlauiſhe company.
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:7663:132"/> Thus wée ſée howe the Sonne of God was puniſhed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſince the caſe thus ſtandeth, let vs vnderſtande, that forſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche as God ſpared not him, that wée for our partes ſhall not bée ſpared: and yet notwithſtanding hée hath giuen vs occaſion to humble our ſelues, to the ende wée ſhoulde not waxe prowde, and take in hand to iuſtifie our ſelues, or els not caſt our ſinnes behind our backes, but dayly thinke vpon them and bée aſhamed, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as wée ſée howe deare a recompence was made for them. For, is this ſuch a triflyng matter? If a miſerable and wretched théefe ſhall haue committed many theftes and robberies, and after that his wicked déedes were knowne, the ſonne of a King ſhoulde bée brought to be arrained and condemned for the ſame, and ſo beare the puniſhment therof, &amp; the théefe to be diſcharged and pardoned, ſhould he reioyce and make a ſcofe at him, whenas he ſée the ſonne of a King to bée put to death, and ſuffer the puniſhment that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued? Euen ſo at this preſent fareth it with vs. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde howe Ieſus Chriſte the onely ſonne of God is impriſoned, and wée deliuered, hée condemned, and wée pardoned: he put to all ſhame, and we receiued to honour, at laſt hée deſcended into the bottomeles pit of Hell, and the kingdome of heauen is ſet open for vs to enter into. And therfore when we here al theſe things, is it for vs to be drowſie headed &amp; liue ſecurely, and to delight and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our ſelues in our ſinnes and iniquities? Wherefore, let vs well conſider of the meaning of the holy Ghoſte, and alwayes weigh theſe wordes, That it was the wyll of God to haue him thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted: as if hée ſhoulde haue ſaide,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Actes.</hi> 2.23. <hi>&amp; 4.</hi>28.</note> That it is not for vs to thinke that our Lord Ieſus was forſaken, as that the wicked ones might torment him at their will and pleaſure: For, as Saint Peter ſaith in the Actes of the Apoſtles, They could doe nothing againſt him otherwiſe then had béen determined before by the ſecret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of God. And therefore it is not for naught that the Prophete bringeth vs alwaies back to this, that we muſt lift our minds vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, &amp; acknowledge y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he being iudge of the world, would be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfied for our ſinnes &amp; offences euen in the perſon of our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt his only ſonne, to the end we might be diſcharged of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and that it was not without cauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ieſus Chriſte was ſo rudely: ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deled, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we might looke vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cherefullier: and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we might vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that God would not reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber our faults, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> made vs to be as it
<pb facs="tcp:7663:133"/> were deteſtable in his ſight. Wherefore, when wée ſhall haue knowne all this, we ſhall haue greatly profited not onely for a day, but alſo all the dayes of our life. For to ſay the trueth, it is a doctrine wherewith wee muſt ſo acquaint our ſelues, as that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we thinke we know it wel enough, yet y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we muſt not ceaſe more &amp; more to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme our ſelues thereto. And for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> more liuely expreſſing héere of, ſée why the prophet goeth on further and ſaith, <hi>That hee will make his ſoule an offering for ſin:</hi> to wit, that Ieſus Chriſt will forget his own life for the redéeming of our liues, &amp; the price of our ſinnes and iniquities. Héere the Prophet againe ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth before vs the willing obedience of the Sonne of God: For, as hee hath ſaide, that as it was the will of the father hee ſhoulde bee afflicted, euen ſo likewiſe hée nowe ſaith, that the Sonne yéelded himſelfe willingly thereto, thruſting himſelfe forwarde to become a Sacrifice without force or conſtraint. For, the common maner of offering vp of Sacrifices vnto the Lorde God, was alwayes done of a francke will and deuotion. And therfore it muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily fall out that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte ſhoulde yéelde and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vp himſelfe to the death, which he ſuffered. For, without that, (as yeſterday was declared) our rebellions had neuer béen repared before God: But when he offered vp his ſoule, to wit, that he was preſt and redy to ſuffer the condemnation that we deſerued, in this we may ſée, that we haue by his death full aſſurance of ſaluation. And this he himſelfe ſaith in the Goſpell after Saint Iohn, No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 16.18.</note> ſaith he, ſhal take away my life, but I wil fréely offer it vp my ſelfe. In déede, his life was taken from him when he was crucified, and wée ſée alſo how vngently &amp; furiouſly they dealt with him that crucified him. Howbeit they coulde neuer haue doone any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, do the beſt they had could, without it had béen ſo before ordeined by the ſacred decrée &amp; appointment of God the father, as hath béen alredy alledged out of the Actes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts.</hi> 2.<hi>23. &amp;</hi> 4.28.</note> where it is ſaide. That they did nothing but that which the hand and counſell of God had ordeined. But ouer and beſides all this, our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte was conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted &amp; well pleaſed with the ſentence &amp; iudgement y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was giuen vpon him for our ſakes. Now the prophet ſetteth it namely down y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was, <hi>for ſin.</hi> For, all ſacrifices were called ſin offerings, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he who had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted an offence, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came to aſk par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, brought his ſacrifice with him, &amp; thereupon was diſcharged:
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7663:133"/> as if hée ſhould haue ſaid, Alas my good God, behold I ſtande héere before thée as a guiltie &amp; condemned perſon: and it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for mee to beare the puniſhment y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue deſerued for it: but ſhould rather bée a burden vtterly to caſt mée downe into the pit of hell: Howebeit for remedie héereof, I craue pardon at thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties hand by meane of the ſacrifice which héere is offered vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thée. Héere we ſee why they were called ſinne offeringes: to wit, becauſe the curſe which we deſerued, &amp; vnder the which we were altogether caſt downe, was as it were diſcharged, and laid vpon a bullocke or ſhéepe, or vpon ſome ſuch like thing that was offered. Now, all this was done in the lawe vnder a figure. So then, our Lorde Ieſus was called ſinne, becauſe he bare our curſe, that God his Father might bleſſe vs. Neither let vs thinke that this is any whit derogatory from his Maieſtie, but that wée ought rather ſo much the more to magnifie him: For as S. Paule ſaith in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the Corinthes, That hée who knew not what ſin meant,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.</note> was made ſinne for vs, that we might be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> righteouſnes of God in him. There is no doubt but that Saint Paul meant to ſet foorth vnto vs the fruite, and benefite of the death and paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, euen as the Prophet héere ſetteth it downe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. Wée ſée then that Ieſus Chriſt was innocent, without ſpot or wrinkle. And therefore ſince it is ſo, hée was méeteſt to beare the charge of others. Nowe hée in ſuch ſort beare it, as that hée was made ſinne: to wit, hée ſuſteined our curſe. And how ſo? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, to the ende that wée now might haue righteouſneſſe to aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere the Maieſtie of God. For the obedience of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is as a cloke to couer al our iniquities: and beſides, his blood is as a thing to cleanſe vs, when wée are waſhed therein, and as Saint Peter ſaith, Bedeawed and begot therewith by his holy Spirite. Héere then wée ſée the meaning of this place,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>1. Pet.</hi> 1.2.</note> Marke alſo héere againe, that to the ende wée might deteſt and abhorre both our ſins &amp; our ſelues, we muſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider of the wonderful ſufferings of the ſonne of God: becauſe it is ſo ſtrange a thing, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it ought to put vs in a maruellous admiration: that he who is the fountaine of all righteouſnes, was made ſinne: that hée who is bleſſed, &amp; ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth all things, yea euen the very Angels of heauen, became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed. Nowe, when wée heare all theſe thinges ſpoken of, and ſée them to bée very ſtrange, yet haue wée not the wit and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb facs="tcp:7663:134"/> to apply them to our edifying. For ſince the Sonne of God was brought to this point, is it poſſible for vs to finde any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy els where? No ſurely: for wée may ſoone iudge, that neither men, Angels, nor nothing els whatſoeuer, was able to doe vs any good, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we muſt néedes haue our help at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of the ſonne of God. And therfore this Diuel <hi>Seruetus</hi> (which was héere execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) is ſo much the more accurſed and damnable: becauſe he hath falſified &amp; ſtayned the holy Bible, in ſaying that all this was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied of <hi>Cyrus</hi> an Heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Idolater: and robbed our Lord Ieſus Chriſte of the thing which ſo properly belonged vnto him, as that when Iſaiah had faſtened this as it were vnto a liuely Table, that euen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieſus Chriſt was crucified, the things could not be made more manifeſt and plaine. And yet this Diuell brought with him ſuch an horrible wickedneſſe, as that hée hath ſpoyled our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt both of his dignitie and office, and ſaith, That it was an Heathen man that ſuffered for the people, whenas in déede what by reaſon of his ambition and couetouſneſſe hée would néedes ſhed the blood of a man, and therefore receiued his iuſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde for the ſame. Howbeit this is a fearefull falſifiyng of this godly Propheſie, and to ſay truely, neuer man aliue euer once thought of any ſuch meanyng, as this curſed fellowe hath deuiſed. For, although a great number of ſhameleſſe Heretikes haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted the doctrine of the holy Scripture, yet neuer did any of them come thus farre. And therefore, it cannot bée choſen but that al the ſignes and tokens of a reprobate appeared in this curſed man. Wherfore, wée are héere ſo much the rather to note, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Prophet bringeth vs backe to the conſideration of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, that (in the firſt place) it is to this ende that wee might bée aſhamed of our ſelues: and beſides, that we might mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the ineſtimable goodneſſe of our God, becauſe hée would haue his onely Sonne to become ſinne for vs: and that our Lord Ieſus Chriſte himſelfe refuſed it not, but as one forgetting himſelfe had ſuch care of our ſaluation, as that hée deſcended into the bottome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les depthes of horror, to the ende hee would beare our curſe. And therefore wée are héere alſo to conſider of this point, that there is none other meane for vs to be diſcharged before God, but to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs the ſatiſfaction of the Sacrifice which was offered vp for vs once for all. Indéede this is very true, that the worlde alwaies
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7663:134"/> hath a meaning to deuiſe ſome one thing or an other, I know not what, wherewith to pay God (as hath heeretofore béene ſaide) and for example, wée ſée what ſtore of pretie fonde triflyng bables ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Papiſtes vſe wherwith to appeaſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrath of god For in déed, they tell vs that it is impoſſible for vs to bée forgiuen, without we make ſatiſfaction: for, ſay they, although God of his frée mercy &amp; goodneſſe forgiueth vs the fault, yet hée reſerueth alwayes the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, vntill ſuch time as euery of vs hath diſcharged himſelf before him. And héereupon wée ſée from whence commeth the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Purgatorie: For, becauſe wée cannot whiles wée lyue héere make ſatiſfaction, but that there muſt remaine alwaies ſome remnant and arrerages, wée muſt therefore, ſay they, beare the puniſhment out of this worlde, &amp; that is it that muſt pay god. Loe héere howe the miſerable worlde hath béen deceiued and blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lead with the leaſinges and doting dreames of Satan. And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore wée are ſo much the rather to make an obſeruation of this doctrine: That as God hath not ſet downe in the Law, and ſaide, You ſhall not ſerue mée this way, and that, as pleaſeth you: But placed and ordeined the ſacrifices, &amp; Ceremonies conteined in the Law, &amp; thereon ſtay them ſelues without deuiſing any newe and ſtrange kind of Seruice &amp; meane to obteine fauour &amp; grace: Euen ſo likewiſe muſt we at this day be contented with the death and paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, becauſe we know that that is the only meane by which God will be mercifull &amp; fauourable vnto vs, &amp; by which alſo he wil receiue &amp; adopt vs vnto himſelfe. Thus we namely ſée what it is that the Prophet meaneth to offer héere vnto vs. Now, it is moreouer ſaid, <hi>That he will prolong his dayes, &amp; that he ſhall ſee his ſeed to be permanent, &amp; that the wil</hi> (or ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) <hi>of the Lorde ſhall proſper in his handes.</hi> Héere, he bringeth vs yet once againe back vnto the conſideration of the glory &amp; excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to the end wee might be ſo muche the more aſſured y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we may come vnto him: for if hée had remoued in death as a vanquiſhed perſon, it had béen impoſſible for vs to haue béen euer iuſtified &amp; quickened by his grace. For how could death a lone haue brought righteouſnes &amp; life with it, as of it ſelfe: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſacrifice of his death he roſe again, therin reſteth our ful &amp; whole co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Thus we ſée y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue obteined victory ouer ſin, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end we might be take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be righteous: &amp; death is aboliſhed in vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7663:135"/> wée might haue life: In déede, this in the firſt place, hath relation vnto the perſon of the Sonne of God, For, as wée haue alredy ſaid hée dyed according to the infirmitie of his fleſhe,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.<hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> howbeit, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly power of his holy Spirite was ſhewed in his reſurrection: and heereof hée gaue this teſtimony, for theſe were his wordes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy yée this Temple, and within thrée dayes I will rayſe it vp againe.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2.19.</note> Loe héere howe the Sonne of God, as touching his perſon did ſée a great age: For hee roſe not againe to ſhew himſelfe vnto the worlde for a whyle, and then dye againe: But after hée had ſhewed himſelfe vnto his Diſciples, and made them witneſſes of his reſurrection, hée aſcended into heauen, and ſo exempted himſelf from all humane frailtie. This then it is whereon wee muſt builde our faith in him, when as wee ſée him to haue in ſuch ſort o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome death, and the Diuell, and triumphed ouer him, as that after that hée was offered vp for a Sacrifice, hée was receiued and exalted vnto this power and dignitie, whereof mention hath alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy béen made. But wée muſt alſo note by the way, that all this belongeth to the whole body of the Church: for it is not the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Ieſus Chriſte to ſeparate himſelfe from it.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11.</note> And in déede it is further ſaid, that <hi>hee ſhall ſee his ſeed.</hi> True it is wée are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the brethren of Ieſus Chriſte: For wée coulde not bée called the children of god but by the ſame name. And therfore, hée who is the onely beloued muſt receiue and ioyne vs ſo vnto himſelfe, as that we might haue that by adoption, which is onely his by nature howbeit, this is no let vnto vs from being as children ingendred of his ſéede. For, what is the true ſéede of the Churche? Verily euen the worde of the Goſpell as Saint Peter telleth vs.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.<hi>23. &amp;</hi> 25.</note> And in déede it is the very ſelfe &amp; ſame which we haue already ſéene very<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied vnto vs out of the Prophet Iſaiah, That the worde of the Lorde endureth for euer, becauſe by it wee are made incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 40.8.</note> whenas wee receiue profite thereby, according to that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that it is giuen vnto vs by the holy ghoſt, this then is the ſéede by which wee are regenerate into euerlaſting life. Howbeit wee muſt fyrſt come vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. And how commeth it to paſſe that the Goſpell hath this office and Property to beget vs to bée the children of GOD, Forſooth the reaſon is this, becauſe the blood of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte was a true
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:7663:135"/> ſéede to quicken vs. And therefore it is not for naught ſayde héere. <hi>That hee ſhall ſee a ſeede of long continuance, or an euerlaſting ſeede.</hi> So then, wee are againe to conclude, that the benefit which our Lorde obteined by his reſurrection, was not particuler for him ſelfe alone: But that wée might haue parte thereof, and be called vnto his company, becauſe we are members of his bodie.</p>
               <p>Nowe, wée are héere, by the way admoniſhed, not to ſéeke for one droppe of life in our ſelues, but to take it wholly from our lord Ieſus Chriſt. Why? howe will God then acknowledge vs to be his children? Howe ſhall wée haue any place in his Church? Howe ſhall wée be taken to be of his flocke? Forſooth wée muſt come to this point, Becauſe wée are partakers with our lord Ieſus Chriſt: Thus wée ſée howe God accepteth of vs, this is our begetting, and firſt birth. And nowe let our fréewill men goe and brag of their frée will, by which they ſuppoſe them ſelues to be readie to receiue the grace of God. For what abilitie is hée able to haue to doe, eyther good or yll, that is not yet begotten in the wombe of his mother. Wherefore, let vs vnderſtande thus much, that ſince our chiefe and firſt creation is this, that we are begotten in Ieſus Chriſt, that wée are able to doe nothing, neither yet that any thing procéedeth from our power and ſtrength, but that all whatſoeuer wée haue, commeth from that frée goodneſſe of his, whereof we are made partakers. And this is the ſumme and effect of all that which wée haue to conſider of. But by the way, to the ende wée might alſo haue a great deale the better taſte of his death &amp; paſſion, it is ſaide,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe hee gaue his ſoule an offring for ſinne</hi> (to wit, for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or for ſacrifice) <hi>that hee ſhould ſee his ſeede.</hi> For, wée right well ſhewe, that wée would blot out all hope of ſaluation, if wée glorified not the goodneſſe of God, in the death and paſſion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. And to ſay truely, they that proudly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine to cleaue vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe hée was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, rightly declare that they haue not knowne the ende thereof: For without it, what ſhould become of vs? Surely, wée ſhoulde haue no Church in the worlde, there ſhould be no ſaluation, and to be ſhort, there ſhould bée no hope of any goodneſſe: For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt wée ſhould bée all remedileſſe confounded, loſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, without Ieſus Chriſt had offred vp his ſoule, &amp; bought
<pb facs="tcp:7663:136"/> vs againe by that onely meane.</p>

                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.<hi>30.</hi>
                  </note>And for this cauſe the Scripture alſo oftentimes ſheweth vs, that wee were redéemed with no ſmall price. And thus much we haue to conſider of for this pointe.</p>
               <p>Nowe, it is ſaide, for a finall concluſion, <hi>That the will of God ſhall proſper in his handes.</hi> The wordes which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet heere vſeth, ſignifieth a worldly will, and frée fauour: For, it were not enough that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſhould execute the will of God: But that it ſhoulde be a will procéeding of loue, as a teſtimony of his fatherly affection. For, Moſes executed the will of God when hée publiſhed the lawe: and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding euerie man was afeard at the thunders &amp; lightnings: for there was nothing els but threatnings of death. And why ſo? Forſooth, becauſe the law brought nothing els with it but wrath and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance. For, it was méet that the world ſhould féele in it an horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condemnation,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12.18.</note> &amp; be wonderfully afeard. Howbeit, there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an other maner of wil of God, in Ieſus Chriſt: &amp; that is this, his meaning was to receiue vs vnto himſelf, &amp; to haue mercy vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, to aboliſh our ſins, &amp; to diſcharge vs of the condemnation wherein we were. Thus we ſée y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> propertie of the ſpéech which the Prophet here vſeth, when he ſaith, That y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wil of God ſhould proſper. Now it is by &amp; by after ſaid, in <hi>his hands,</hi> which ſignifieth, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ieſus Chriſt ſhould be a diſtributer and beſtower of the grace of God for our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. True it is, that God might by ſome other death haue deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vs from death, howbeit it was not his meaning, neyther yet was it ſo good. And therefore hée appointed our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to the ende wée might by him, be redéemed and reconcy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: and to bée ſhort, that by him wée might obtayne whatſoeuer was requiſite for our ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Let vs nowe make a collection of the ſumme and effect of this ſaying, It is ſaide, <hi>That the good will and free fauour of GOD ſhould proſper in the hands of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Wherefore ſpeaketh the Prophet after this maner? Forſooth, becauſe, we are enclyned vnto miſtruſt, and haue a number of lettes to make vs fainte, the holie Ghoſt, preuenteth the matter, and declareth vnto vs, that howſoeuer the worlde goeth, the grace of God ſhall worke it ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and be accompliſhed,</p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:7663:136"/>
               <p>And therefore, although the Deuill craftely goeth about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe to make the death and paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt to bée of no force and effect vnto vs, and bring foorth no fruit in vs: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wée for our partes are ſo wicked and peruerſe, as that wée will ſo fall from it, as that wée will make it altogether vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable vnto vs: yet will God by his infinite goodneſſe ouercome it all. To bée ſhorte, the Prophete his meaning héere in this place is, that the death and paſſion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, hath not béene onely ſufficient for the ſaluation of the worlde, but alſo that God will make it ſo forcible, as that wée ſhall ſée the fruite thereof, and féele and proue it by experience.</p>
               <p>And heerevpon wée are to gather, that God will alwayes haue a Church in the worlde, and that the Deuill may very wel deuiſe all the miſchiefe hée can poſſible, and bende all his force to ouerthrowe the houſe of God, and yet, be as be may, Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſhall haue the victorie, and the grace, whereof hée is a diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buter and beſtower, ſhall bée beneficiall, and perfourmed amongſt men.</p>
               <p>And for this cauſe it is ſaide by the Pſalmiſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.1.</note> Why haue the Kinges and Rulers of the earth lifted vp themſelues? and made co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenantes with the people? Yet muſt God in the ende, execute his Counſell and iudgement. In verie déede, they will goe about to imagine muche, but yet hée which dwelleth aboue in the heauens will mocke them all to ſcorne in his wrath. Let vs therefore well conſider, that the meaning of the holie Ghoſt is to declare, that the death and paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt wil alwayes worke his effect, to the end the Church of God might ſtande firme and ſure, ſo that it ſhall neuer be ouerthrowne, by all the aſſaultes, tempeſtes and whirlewyndes, whatſoeuer that the enemies with Satan their head, can any way poſſible raiſe vp againſt it. And this ſaying, to <hi>proſper,</hi> is ſet downe, to ſhew, that God will make the death and paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt floriſh, to the end it might more and more fructifie: and when it ſhall ſéeme, that it ſhoulde bée vtterly defaced; that God will vpholde it, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come whatſoeuer may bée any let for the bringing of it to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ende. Moreouer, euery of vs ought to apply this vnto himſelfe, and not doubt, that although our winges flagge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaues of ſin, yet that God will deliuer vs from out of that ſlauerie
<pb facs="tcp:7663:137"/> wherin we are, make perfect that which hée hath begun in vs, and amend alſo whatſoeuer is wanting in vs. And how? Forſooth, wee muſt firſt come vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: becauſe it is he which putteth to his hande, and to him the charge thereof is committed, and this office hée receiued from God his Father. And therefore let vs be contented, that ſince hee is appointed to be the Miniſter of our ſaluation, there ſhall be no defect or want which hée will not accompliſh by his meane, and that becauſe hée hath ſo determined it.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19.</note> Now, let vs by the way, apply to this which is héere ſet downe, the place of Saint Paul before by vs alledged, to the end we might be partakers of the fruit of the death and paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: that is, let vs giue eare vnto the meſſage that is dayly brought vs. For it were not enough that Ieſus Chriſt had ſuffred in his owne perſon, and appointed to be a ſacrifice for vs: but wée muſt alſo be certified thereof by the Goſpell: that wée haue this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony by it, and not doubt but that wée are iuſtified by him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we knowe that hée hath made ſatiſfaction for our offences. And therevpon let vs looke that God will in ſuch ſort continue his woorke in this Redéemer, as that hée will make it encreaſe more and more, vntill hée hath brought it to a full end and perfection.</p>
               <p>Let vs now fall downe before the Maieſtie of our good God, and acknowledge our offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, beſéeching him ſo to make vs féele them, as that wée may be more &amp; more diſpleaſed with them, &amp; alſo learne vs ſo to looke into the death and paſſion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, as that it may be a good inſtruction for vs to be gréeued and grone for our ſinnes &amp; not doubt, ſince that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt hath diſcharged vs of that whereof we were guiltie, but that wée might nowe come before the Maieſtie of God his Father, and be receiued as his children, although in déede we are vnworthie to be reckoned amongſt the number of his creatures. And that wée may in this ſtrength fight againſt all our vices and wicked luſtes, and ſo bée made partakers of the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, as alſo we might be ſtrengthened, to make all our whole life agréeable vnto God: and as hée hath ſhewed him ſelfe fauourable vnto vs, we might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo labour moſt obediently to pleaſe him. That it would pleaſe him not to ſhew this fauour vnto vs onely, but alſo vnto all people and nations on the earth, &amp;c.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough the Prophet, for a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that which hée hath alredy ſaid, bringeth in this ſentence: to wit, that the death of the Sonne of God ſhoulde not be vnprofitable, but ſhould yéeld a moſt excellent fruite for the ſaluation of the worlde: yet doeth hée more liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet it foorth then héeretofore hée hath done: For, in the firſt place, hée ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto vs the loue whiche Ieſus Chriſt beare vs, ſaying, <hi>That hee ſhall be ſatisfied,</hi> by reaſon hée had purchaſed for vs, by his death, euerlaſting life: and beſides, hee ſheweth in the ſecond place, that hée ſhall not ſuffer onely in his bodie, but in his ſoule alſo. Nowe, we knowe that this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to be Satiſfied, or to be Contented, importeth or carieth with it, a great deſire. For, many thinges ſhall come to paſſe, which ſhall touch vs no whit, and we ouerſlip them: yea, and although they be for our commoditie, yet is not for vs to ſay, that we altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſt in them. And a man may haue a great number of things, and yet not be contented: For it is poſſible that he hath not the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall, or els that hée hath not the whole: But the Prophet ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Sonne of God ſhal be throughly ſatiſfied, neuer reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him ſelfe, when as hée ſhall ſée that hée hath gotten vnto him his Church, and that poore ſinners ſhal be deliuered from the curſe wherein they were, and ſo be reconciled vnto God, for the obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:7663:138"/> of the heauenly enheritance. To be ſhort, wée ſée here that our Lorde Ieſus neuer reſpected his owne perſon, but was raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the loue of vs, wherin hée ſought his whole contentment and felicitie, as if that had béene his onely deſire, loue, and care. Now, we haue againe here to note, that if ſo be we looke for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite which our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt purchaſed for vs, by Fayth, which is dayly offred vnto vs by the Goſpell, wée ſhall neuer be voide of our hope. For the Prophet ſayeth, <hi>That hee ſhall ſee,</hi> by which hée expreſſeth, that God doeth not onely meane to ſhewe his mercy vnto vs in the perſon of his Sonne, when as hée deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered him to death: But will bring it alſo to paſſe by his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, that this his death ſhall not be fruitleſſe, and that many ſhall ſee, &amp; finde by experience, that it was not in vayne, nor for naught, that hée ſuffred ſo great tormentes. And therefore let vs embraſe our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, to the end we drawing neare vnto him by fayth, might be made partakers of the fruite of his death &amp; paſſion: and let vs be aſſured, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſoeuer we ſhal at any time eſtrange our heartes from him, that God will not adde this benefit with the reſt, that as his wil was that his Sonne ſhould be our Redéemer, euen ſo alſo ſhould we truly enioy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> benefit which he hath brought vs, and vnderſtande that it was not in vaine that hée ſuffred ſuch cruell torments for vs. And this is the thing which we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of out of this place. As for the ſecond point which is propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it is here ſhewed that Ieſus Chriſt ſhould not onely be beaten, ſcourged, and afflicted by the hand of God his father, that he might beare the chaſtiſement which wée were woorthie of, but that his ſoule alſo ſhoulde bée gréeued and vexed. It is not héere ſaid, that hée ſhall ſée the fruite of his ſtrypes, affliction, and death, as the Prophet had before ſaide: But alſo the fruite <hi>of the trauayle and griefe of his ſoule.</hi> For the woordes which hée vſeth, importeth as much. And therefore hée meant to expreſſe that Ieſus Chriſt was not onely crucified, after hée had aboad the gréeuous torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in his bodie, but that hée ſhould goe a great deale farther: to wyt, that hée ſhould be heauy and ſory for vs, and ſuffer the ſorrowes of death, and be euen ſubiect theretoo for our iuſtification. And to ſay truly, to what purpoſe had it bin, if our Lord Ieſus Chriſt had but openly ſuffred, &amp; in the ſight of the world? For if he had ſuffred but in body, hee ſhould then haue bin a Redéemer of bodies onely.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7663:138"/> But becauſe the principall matter why wée ſhould beléeue in him, is, that we might féele and be fully perſuaded, that death ſhal be no more deadly vnto vs, and that wée are freed from the curſe of God, it was méet that our Lord Ieſus ſhoulde féele theſe pointes in himſelfe: &amp; ſo comming before God, might be as a wretched male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor before his Iudge. For, we know that the ſin of man brought not with it a temporall death onely, but alſo a féeling of the enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of God, and of his horrible iudgement againſt vs. And what is that? Forſooth, the moſt inſupportable and terrible thing that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly may be. And therfore it was méet that our Lord Ieſus ſhuld be driuen theretoo, for our deliuerance: and this is it whiche the Prophet at this preſent declareth vnto vs. And héere we ſée a great deale the better, howe God hath loued vs, and what the infinite Treaſures of his grace and goodneſſe are, which hée hath powred out vpon vs. Moreouer, wee may alſo verie well vnderſtande, what care and zeale our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt had ouer our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when as hée forced not to make his owne bodie anſwere the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction of our ſinnes, but alſo to bring him ſelfe into ſuch an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible feare, as one that ſhould féele the iudgement of God, who layde holde on him, as vpon him who had deſerued the curſe which God had pronounced from his owne mouth: to wyt, that it was the verie thing to ſwallowe vs vp into hell, and a gulfe vtterly to deſtroy vs. And therefore it was méete that Ieſus Chriſt ſhould féele all this. Nowe, to ſay the trueth, when wée ſée that hée had thereby ſweat water and blood,<note place="margin">Luk. 22.3.</note> and that the Angels came downe to comfort him: this could not chooſe but be an wonderfull extream ſorrow and griefe: ſéeing the like example had neuer béen ſéene all the worlde ouer. Thus we ſée the meaning of theſe wordes, <hi>Of the trauaile, or griefe of the ſoule of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Nowe, it is true (as Saint Peter ſayeth) that the ſorrowes of hell could not hold him vnder: howbeit it was méet hée ſhould ſtriue with them:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 2.24.</note> and in the end hée had the victorie ouer them, but it was not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great and painefull fight. Moreouer, wée are preſently to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of this place, that although wée muſt dye, wée muſt not therefore ſay that the death and paſſion of Chriſt was not effectual, nor yet profited vs ſo much as was expedient: becauſe, the death wherevnto wée are nowe ſubiect, is but a warning vnto vs of the curſe of God.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7663:139"/>
               <p>For, if wée were clearely exempt from death, we ſhould then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer know the grace which was purchaſed for vs by our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. And we alſo knowe what néede we haue to bée hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and that God maketh vs alwayes to féele his wrath: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we were altogether exempt thereof, yet ought we to think ſtill of it, to the ende we might grone by reaſon of our ſinnes, and therefore magnifie his mercy ſo much the more. Wherefore, the death to ſpeake properly, which all men now dye as it were, is not deadly, to thoſe which haue faith in Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe they paſſe out of this life, to liue vnto God. And therefore when we dye, wée are to comfort our ſelues and reioyce, becauſe we know that God will be mercifull vnto vs, and conuert the euill into good, &amp; make death (which before brought with it a mortall wound) to ſerue for a plaiſter. And howe is that? Forſooth, becauſe we ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande that God will not become a ſeuere Iudge vnto vs, &amp; poure out his vengeance vpon vs, when as we bring Ieſus Chriſt with vs, to ſhewe that hée hath made ſatiſfaction for vs. And therfore death hath not taken ſuch fearefull holde on vs, as to confound vs, and bring vs to diſpaire:<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.39. &amp; 10.28.</note> But doe come, fréely to put our ſelues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the handes of God. For, as it ſaid that Ieſus Chriſt commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his ſoule vnto God his Father, Let vs vnderſtand, that it was to make him Gardaine of our ſoules, and therefore may wée com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende them moſt aſſuredly into his handes: becauſe hée hath ſaid, that whatſoeuer is giuen to him to kéepe, ſhall neuer periſh. Thus then we ſée to what ende this anguiſh of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt ſerueth: and that ouer and beſides he aboad death, and the reſt of the tormentes, yet had hée alſo this terrour of the féeling of God to be his Iudge, as if hée ſhoulde haue ſuffred the paynes of hell. Nowe, it is ſo farre off that this is any whit derogatorie from his Maieſtie, as that it is to make vs a great deale the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, howe greatly hée eſtéemed of our ſaluation, and how deare and precious we and our ſoules were vnto him. And therefore, although hée was made of no reputation (as before hath béen ſéene) and had neither fourme nor faſhion, why men ſhoulde be deſirous of him, yet was this his light eſtimation of him to exalte him ſo much the more.</p>
               <p>And in déede, although God ſhewed his highneſſe and infinite Maieſtie in the creation of the worlde, yet haue we a farre more
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7663:139"/> large cauſe to glorifie God in the death and paſſion of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, becauſe Ieſus Chriſt abaſed and humbled him ſelfe for vs and for our ſaluation: and although hée was not robbed of his diuine Maieſtie, yet laye it hyd for a time, and was neuer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by any man. And this is in ſumme, that which the Prophet here handleth, as concerning the payne and greefe of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Now, we ſée herein that hée forgot him ſelfe as it were, and neuer cared for him ſelfe, and the reaſon is, becauſe hée was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether giuen to ſaue vs: And ſo anſwered for vs both in bodie and ſoule, and was our onely pledge. And in this we ſée, that the verie curres who would at this day aboliſh this doctrine, haue neyther faith nor religion in them, but bark at it like Maſtifes, they know not why nor wherfore. And although our Popiſh hypocrites who vnderſtand this but by halfes, are yet notwithſtanding, howſoeuer the world goeth, driuen to confeſſe, that Ieſus Chriſt felt moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible panges. In déed they were neuer able fully to define of al that was in it: But yet, how euer it commeth to paſſe, they iumble part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at it. Notwithſtanding, there are here a company of villaynes, more Monkiſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they which liue in their Celles, &amp; in thoſe ſtews out of which they come, who haue brought their ſtench &amp; infectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church of God. And therefore this is moſt certaine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theſe Dogges which at this day carry the name of Miniſters, and do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo occupie that place, and yet make a Swynes ſtye of the Church of God, being like Dogges without all religion, and goe about no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but to deface and put out of mens mindes all the grace of God, and whatſoeuer els our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath done for vs. Now, when we ſée that Satan hath thus puſhed them forward, as to become like ſhameleſſe whores, we ought ſo much the rather to conſider of this Article of our faith: which is, That Ieſus Chriſt was not onely condemned of Pylate, being an earthly Iudge, to the end we might be pardoned before God his Father: and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly crucified, that wée might be deliuered from the curſe: that hée did not onely ſuffer death, that we might be freed from it, But alſo that we at this day might haue peace of conſcience, and be glad in that we féele the fatherly loue of our God, and ſo may be bolde to call vpon him with open mouth, being aſſured y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he will receiue vs, &amp; that we ſhal be acceptable vnto him. And it was méet y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ieſus Chriſt ſhould be plunged in theſe horrors which he felt, it was alſo
<pb facs="tcp:7663:140"/> méete that he who was the immaculate Lambe of God, ſhould be made like vnto a wretched malefactor, and that hée who was the mirror &amp; paterne of all holineſſe &amp; perfection, ſhould anſwere for vs, and become our Borrow euen to that verie pinch, as if hée ſhoulde haue béen condemned vnto the bottomleſſe pit of hel. Moreouer, he vanquiſhed &amp; ouercame all theſe ſorowes (as we haue before ſaid) but yet he wreſtled ſtoutly againſt them firſt. Thus we ſée what the meaning of Iſaiah is, when he ſaith, that Ieſus Chriſt muſt ſée trauels &amp; griefes in his ſoule: howbeit we ſée that he was notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding well contented and fully ſatiſfied therwith, alwayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided that we might be redeemed by that meane. And therfore wée may at this day be ſo much the more bold, knowing that if we haue a true obedience of fayth, whereby to receiue the ineſtimable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite which our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt hath obtained for vs, wée may féele that hée ſuffred not all theſe torments for vs, in vaine. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, our vnthankfulneſſe ſhall be ſo much the more inexcuſable, when as we come not vnto him with ſuch an earneſt zeale, to enioy this ineſtimable benefite whereinto he is entred, and whereof hée hath in our behalfe, taken poſſeſſion, hauing tolde vs that hée hath reconciled vs vnto God his Father, who is readie to receiue vs as his children. Thus we ſée in ſumme, what we haue to conſider of in this place. Now, the Prophet goeth on farther, and ſaith, <hi>That by his knowledge, my righteous ſeruant ſhall iuſtifie many.</hi> As for this word, <hi>Seruant,</hi> we haue before ſéene, that it is no whit deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie from the maieſtie of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: For, although hée was Lord ouer all Creatures, yet obteined he a newe gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the perſon of a Mediatour, and in our nature, according to that ſaying of Saint Paule to the Philippians, and as we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſéene partly heretofore:<note place="margin">Phil. 2.9.</note> for it was his meaning to become a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, and to humble him ſelfe vnder that ſtate and condition. And therefore it was not in vaine, that hée was called the ſeruaunt of God. Now, this ought to be no ſtraunge thing vnto vs: But this ſhould be much more ſtrange vnto vs, that Ieſus Chriſt being the verie Sonne of God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17.9.</note> and coequall with God his Father in glorie, ſhould become a ſeruant to men (as it is ſaide in the Goſpell after Saint Iohn) and ſo abaſe him ſelfe vnder this condition,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.28</note> as that hée woulde ſerue vs: and yet notwithſtanding it was ſo in déede. Marke alſo why hée ſaide, I was conuerſaunt amongſt you as a ſeruant, and not as a Maiſter.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:7663:140"/>
               <p>Nowe, ſince it is ſo, that Ieſus Chriſt became ſo humble, as to make him ſelfe the ſeruant of men, it is not for naught then that hée is here called the ſeruant of God. And to ſay the truth, he could not otherwiſe haue redéemed vs. I ſpeake now in reſpect that God his Father had ſo decréede it, as we haue alredie heretofore ſayde. For, I know that God could, if it had pleaſed him haue ſaued vs without any meane, But we are alwayes to preſuppoſe that it was Ieſus Chriſt which muſt purchaſe life for vs. And therefore, for the bringing of this matter to paſſe, it was eftſoones méet that he ſhould become a ſeruant: becauſe hee could not otherwiſe haue yéelded his obedience vnto God his Father: and without this obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, it was impoſſible for him to haue repaired our tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and iniquities. Thus then we ſée why he was called a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſeruant. To be ſhort, the Prophet doeth vs to wit, that becauſe we were, and yet are, rebels to God, vntill ſuch time as he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed vs by his holy ſpirit: and againe, although after he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs the touch of a good mind, yet are we vnprofitable ſeruants, and tryp and ſtumble euerie hand while: and beſides, when wée ſhall thinke that the ſeruice which we doe him, ſhould be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him, yet may it be verie well amended, yea &amp; worthie to be reiected: and therefore for the blotting out of our offences, it was méete that the ſeruice and obedience of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſhould pleaſe God: and that it ſhould alſo carry with it a right and full ſatiſfaction. This then is the ſumme and effect of his meaning. And herevpon we are to gather, that Ieſus Chriſt did not onely iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie vs in that he was God, but through the power of his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in that he tooke vpon him our nature, and therein would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh and fulfill the lawe, which was impoſſible for vs to doe, becauſe it was ſuch a burthen as would haue preſſed vs all downe, and haue broken our neckes. Forſomuch then as our Lord Ieſus Chriſt forſooke himſelfe for our ſaluation, and became obedient vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God his Father, we ſée in what ſort he hath iuſtified vs. Now, he ſpeaketh alſo namely of <hi>his knowledge,</hi> meaning thereby to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, that it was not inough that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in his own perſon, all whatſoeuer that was neceſſarie for our ſaluation, but that wee alſo ſhould take faſt hold therof by fayth.</p>
               <p>And therefore knowledge is verie requiſite. For how many incredulous or vnbeléeuing perſons doe we ſée periſhe, vnto whom
<pb facs="tcp:7663:141"/> the death and paſſion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, ſerueth to none other purpoſe, ſaue onely for their greater condemnation, becauſe they treade his moſt holie and precious blood vnder their féete, and vtterly refuſe his grace which hee offreth vnto them.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.9</note> And ſo, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt be lyke vnto the Serpent whiche was ſet vp in the wilderneſſe, for the healing of all diſeaſes, yet can we for our partes receiue no profite by him, except we know him. For, as it was méete alſo that the braſen Serpent ſhould be looked on in the wilderneſſe, and without which looking on, the byting or ſtinging of the Serpentes was alwayes deadly: Euen ſo at this day, is the Goſpell vnto vs as a Scaffolde whereon to ſet vp our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: or els lyke a Banner to repreſent him vnto our eyes,<note place="margin">3. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1.</note> that we might ſée him a great way of. To bee ſhort, The preaching of the Goſpell (as Saint Paule ſayeth) is not darke: For we may in it beholde the grace of God, appearing in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, or els the Deuill hath blindfolded our eyes. But howe euer it is, we are throughly to conſider of that which is here ſpoken, that Ieſus Chriſt iuſtifieth not but by his knowledge. In deede it is moſt true, that the verie ſubſtance of our ſaluation muſt come from thence: For, when it is ſaide, that we are iuſtified by Fayth, this is not to exclude Ieſus Chriſt, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet the mercies of God, but rather to lead vs and bring vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. But to the ende we might the eaſelyer come to the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hereof, we are to conſider in the firſt place, that we are not righteous of our ſelues, ſince we muſt borrowe it of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For if wee were able ſo to rule and order our life, that it might be all in all anſwerable vnto the law, and will of God, then in déed we deſerued that hee ſhould accept vs. And why ſo? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, becauſe he is to allowe of the good, ſince he is the fountayne thereof: for els, hee ſhoulde deny him ſelfe. And therefore if we coulde frame our lyues to agrée with the lawe of God, and bee ſo perfect as hee requireth, we ſhould then without doubt, be iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our woorkes, and Ieſus Chriſt (as Saint Paul ſaith) ſhould profite vs nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 5.4.</note>But contrariwiſe, when we are driuen to borow our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and ſéeke it at his handes: that is as much to ſay, that we are as bare of it, as we ſay, as my nayle.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:7663:141"/>
               <p>Wherefore let vs thus conclude, that the whole worlde is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned of ſinne, and God ſheweth vs that wee are all accurſed, when as it is ſaide, that wee muſt come vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. And thus much for this point. Now, to ſay the trueth, the auncient Philoſophers ſpake thus much of vertue: and this hath béene alwayes a common opinion, that God will accept of vs for our good life and conuerſation: But what are wee the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for all this? For there was nothing but hypocriſie in the beſt liuers, and in ſuch as was thought coulde in no wiſe be touched: and as for the reſt, they were altogether giuen to wickedneſſe: But to ſpeake of thoſe who were thought of all others to bée the moſt able and renowmed people, were notwithſtanding infected with verie gréeuous ſinnes.</p>
               <p>And therefore let men preſume as much as they luſt, and think howe they will to liue vertuouſly, yet when they haue done all they can, and ſet downe many lawes and rules for their gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they ſhall neuer be able to be iuſtified before God by that meane. And why ſo? Forſooth, becauſe ſinne hath taken ſuche déepe roote in vs, as that it cannot bee pulde out of vs by mans helpe. To bee ſhorte, wee ſhall neuer bee iuſtified by goyng to Schoole with men, although they teache neuer ſo muche what vertue is. And that which is more, Beholde, God publiſheth the lawe wherein is true and perfect righteouſneſſe: for marke what Moyſes ſayeth, Beholde, ſayeth hee, I pronounce at this day both good and euill: I ſhewe vnto thee the way both of life and death. But by the way, can wee bee iuſtified by it? Can it ſo order vs, as that God will take our life to bee good and holie?<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.15.</note> No ſurely, it is all cleane contrarie: For the lawe engendreth death, redoubleth our condemnation, and kindleth the wrath of God againſt vs.</p>
               <p>Thus wee ſee what tytles the holie Scripture giueth vnto it. And therefore ſince the lawe of it ſelfe cannot iuſtifie vs, how then is it poſſible for men by their doctrine, ſtatutes, and ordinaunces, make vs to be truely righteous.</p>
               <p>Nowe, if it be aſked howe and wherefore the lawe is not able to iuſtifie: the reaſon is alredie ſet downe. It is true in deed that God declareth vnto vs in his lawe, howe wee ought and may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne vnto lyfe, if ſo bee wee were ſuche as that there were no
<pb facs="tcp:7663:142"/> let in vs. Wherefore, although the lawe of God ſpeaketh vnto vs, yet it refourmeth not our heartes. For, when God telleth vs and ſayeth, Beholde, what it is that I require at your handes: But &amp; if in the meane while all our deſires, affections &amp; thoughts bee altogether againſt that which hee commaundeth, wée are not onely condemned, But the lawe alſo, as I haue alredie ſaide, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs ſo muche the more guiltie before the Maieſtie of God. For before the lawe was giuen, wée ſinned through ignoraunce: but nowe, wee ſo wittingly and willingly ſtande againſt him, as that it ſéemeth we woulde euen deſpight him. For we know that the ſeruant which knoweth his Maiſters will, and doeth it not, ſhall be beaten with many ſtrypes. Thus we ſee why it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e ſaid, that the lawe engendreth nothing els but wrath: to wit, that when wée haue béen inſtructed in it, it kindleth God his wrath ſo muche the more againſt vs: and bringeth with it death, but howe? Becauſe forſooth we ſée in it, that we are condemned and vtterly caſt away. What? is it ſo that it announceth not life? no: and yet by the way, we cannot attaine theretoo. And therefore we muſt be iuſtified af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an other maner, which is, by the Goſpell. For, God ſaieth not vnto vs in the Goſpell, Beholde, yée ſhall doe this or that: But hée ſaieth, Beléeue that my onely Sonne is your Redeemer: embra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore forſomuch as the Goſpell bringeth vs back vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and commaundeth vs to ſeeke for all our righteouſneſſe in him, becauſe he hath made full ſatiſfaction for vs through the free mercy of God, ſee howe we ſhall be iuſtified by <hi>his knowledge.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> And this is it which Saint Paule handleth in his Epiſtle to the Romanes, For there hee maketh a compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the righteouſneſſe of the lawe, and the righteouſneſſe of Fayth. For, he ſayth, that there is this righteouſneſſe in the lawe, when as it ſayeth, Whoſoeuer ſhall doe all theſe thinges, ſhal liue by them. For, this is moſt true, that if wee be able to fulfill all the commaundementes of God, ſo that our life be in ſuch ſort ruled as that it is without ſpot or wrinckle, God hath promiſed to receyue vs as righteous, that wee ſhall be verie ſure of our rewarde, and

And becauſe the faithleſſe ſhut the gate vpon themſelues, and ſo ſpoyle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues of the benefit which they ſhould receiue by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, let vs therfore be dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to receiue the teſtimonie which is geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto vs by the Goſpel. We bring you (ſaith S Paule) the Ambaſſade in the name of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, beſéeching you to reconcile yourſelues vnto God. S. Paule ſetteth downe a double reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>2.</hi> Cor. 5.10.</note> the one is, the ſacrifice which our Lord Ieſus Chriſt made for vs in his owne perſon, the other is that which wée dailie ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne through fayth, when as GOD telleth vs, that although wée haue mooued him to anger, yet is hée continually readye to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get our faults, and tread them vnder his féete, ſo that we make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of the benefit which he offreth vs.</p>
               <p>And therefore, let vs learne too eſteeme of the Goſpell a greate deale more then heeretofore wee haue done: and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande, that it is to this ende too make vs Partakers of the death and paſſion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. For wee are ingraffed into his bodie, &amp; made his members, and al whatſoeuer
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7663:143"/> is his, is alſo ours, and that through the aptneſſe of the Goſpell: and for this cauſe it is, that Saint Paul ſaith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16.</note> that the Goſpell is the power of God vnto ſaluation, to all that beléeue: ſhewing héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that if we refuſe to be ſaued by the Goſpell, it is as much as if we reiected the ſaluation which God woulde obtaine for vs in the perſon of his Sonne, and wherunto hée dayly bideth and exhorteth vs. And this is the ſumme and effect of that which we haue héere to obſerue.</p>
               <p>And therefore, we ought ſo much the more make eſtimation of the Goſpell, whenas we ſée that it was in popery ſo darkned, yea and in ſuch ſorte, altogether defaced, as that the poore ſoules were vtterly famiſhed. For, although it was ſomewhat ſlightly preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet left they alwaies the poore people doubtfull, and ſuperſtici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, without hauing any aſſueraunce of the mercy of God. Yea, and the Papiſtes ſaye, that wee muſt not preſume to aſſure our ſelues of the loue of God, but onely liue vpon coniectures and geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Howbeit this is to make the fruite of the death and paſſion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt of none effect. And therefore let vs learne ſo to benefite our ſelues by the Goſpell, as that we may bee certified that God loueth vs, and taketh vs for his owne deare chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Wherfore, let vs (as I haue already ſayde) ſo much the more praiſe and magnifye this grace, whenas wée ſée the greateſt part of the world to be ſo farre from it.</p>
               <p>Now, it remaineth that the Prophet addeth and ſaieth, <hi>that he layde downe his ſoule for many.</hi> Whereby he ſignifieth, that wee are not iuſtified by a certaine vaine imaginatiue faith, in onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeuing that there is a God, and by a confuſed knowledge and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall conceit to vnderſtande, that Ieſus Chriſt hath ſuffered death and paſſion: but becauſe wée are made partakers, by fayth, of the ſacrifice that was offered for vs, to the ende God might bée fauourable vnto vs, and not impute our ſinnes and iniquities any more vnto vs. Surely, the Papiſts are ſo blockiſh and brutiſhe, as that when they would ſhew that we are not iuſtified by Faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they reaſon after this maner, we are (ſay they) iuſtified by the mercy of God: and therefore not by faith onely: Moreouer they ſay, we are iuſtified by the death and paſſion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: and therefore no more, by faith onelye: it is much like as if a man woulde ſay, we are made warme by heate, and therefore
<pb facs="tcp:7663:144"/> not by the Sunne: wée are lightned by the light, and therefore not by the Sunne.</p>
               <p>Now, let vs héere note, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when we ſpeake of faith, it is to this end to bring vs back to the Goſpell: for (as I haue already ſaide) héere are two kindes of righteouſneſſe. For we are ſaide to be iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the law, whenas wee haue fulfilled all whatſoeuer God hath commaunded vs therein. Now, it is impoſſible to come to the perfection thereof and therefore wée ſée that wée are bare of this righteouſneſſe, and vtterly cut of from it.</p>
               <p>There is alſo another kinde of righteouſneſſe, and that is the righteouſneſſe of Ieſus Chriſt, for after wee haue bene throughlye examined and tried, we are ſure to be founde guilty of malice and wickedneſſe, ſo that wée muſt needes bée afearde, bicauſe wee feele God to be ſo armed in wrath againſt vs, as that he doth nothing els but thunder out vengeance vpon vs to throw vs down into the pitte of hell. And therefore, when we are driuen to this ſo great an extremitie, beholde how Chriſt graunteth vs a remedy to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and aſſawge all our ſorrowes: which is this, he certefieth vs, that hée him ſelfe alone will be altogether ſufficient to bring vs the ſauing helth which he hath purchaſed for vs. Thus we ſée, that wée are iuſtified, by faith, wherefore wée may perceiue that the Prophet ſpeaketh after the ſelfe ſame manner that Saint Paul ſpake, after his time, that is, hee maketh vs in the firſt place to come vnto the death and paſſion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him crucified for our ſakes, and beſides, that wee are aſſured by the Goſpell that whatſoeuer Ieſus Chriſte dyd and ſuffered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth and is to be applyed to vs at this day, becauſe the Father would not haue this his death to be vnprofitable: but that it ſhould bée a Sacrifice full of power and effect, to fruictifie dayly in vs. And this is the ſumme of that which wée haue, to remember out of this place. But by the way, let vs héere note, that this knowledge of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt is no vaine thing: as many, when the knowledge of the Goſpell is tolde them of, vnderſtande it, for they think it ſufficient, if they doo but ſleightly conceiue of that whiche is taught: but wée are taught to take our Lorde Ieſus to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſe of our ſaluation.</p>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7663:144"/> receiue vs once for al to his mercy, euen ſo he at this day encreaſeth the ſame in vs. And to ſay the trueth, it is impoſſible for vs to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to this knowledge, except we be inlightened with his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. Which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue obteined, it is an vndoubted ſigne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god meaneth to worke in vs, to the ende he woulde put vs into the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that righteouſneſſe, from the which wée were before ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry farre of, Wée ſee then that God would gladly haue the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell preached. But yet that is not enough: for, we ſhoulde vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande no more of it, then an high Almane (as we ſay) vntill ſuche time as he inwardly touched vs with his holy ſpirite (thus wée ſée from whence faith procéedeth) and then are we the true &amp; good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Ieſus Chriſt, able to feele the fruite of this doctrine. And this is it, which the Prophet here ſheweth vnto vs. Now, he again maketh a recitall of Ieſus Chriſt his bearing of ſinnes, whereby he meaneth to declare, that he made ſatiſfaction for them, and that our ſinnes ſhould be ſuch a charge as ſhould caſt vs headlong into the bottomeles pit of hel if we were not holpen &amp; eaſed by our lord Ieſus Chriſt. For what is meant by ſin, but the very wrath of god? For, if God but once hold vp his finger, it is enough to deſtroy and ouerthrow the whole world: for it is ſaid, that with his breath the rockes ſhould riue in péeces,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.32.</note> &amp; the mountaines bee ſoftned &amp; melt like waxe. Wherefore, if God ſheweth the leaſt token of his fury and wrath, there is nothing ſo firme &amp; ſure in the worlde, but ſhall melt away: and what ſhall become of vs then, who are ſo fraile creatures, when as God ſhall ſhewe vnto vs the face of a terrible iudge, &amp; call vs to an account? Were it not méete that we ſhoulde hearken vnto his voice: howebeit the only ſigne that hee will giue vs to ſummon withall ſhalbe a bottomeles depth to ſwalow vs vp in. And therfore it cannot be choſen but that our ſinnes muſt néeds bée a burden not able for vs to beare. Nowe, there is an infinite number of them in vs: and we haue not the ſhoulders to ſtand vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der them and to beare them.

And therefore if wee be ouercharged, let vs come vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte that we might be eaſed, and acknowledge him to be the meane, becauſe we are ſo diſcharged by him of al our debts, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we muſt not once ima<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gine that we are euer able to make ſatiſfaction, or payment, when as we ſhal come to make our Audite before God, we muſt therfore beginne at this end to be vtterly aſhamed: and beſides, not ſtand in doubt but that we are nowe diſcharged, ſince our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte hath borne our burden: and that wee may alſo be bold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we knowe that we are freed from the iudgement of God.

                     <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.19.</note> Thus wee ſée how our Lord Ieſus Chriſt made a ſpoyle of his enimies, to wit, becauſe we might be no more vnder the tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nie of Satan, &amp; the bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage of ſin, but be ſet at libertie. And to ſay the trueth, S. Paule alleadging the ſaying of the Pſalmiſt, ſheweth after what ſort this place was fulfilled, when it is ſaide, That God aſcended on high, and lead captiuitie captiue: and kept his enimies bound and fettered, ſo that they were not able to reſiſt him: receiuing alſo homage and tribute of men. Indéede Dauid in that place ſpeaketh by way of ſimilitude: For when it is ſaid that God aſcended on high, it was becauſe he made a ſhew for a time as
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7663:146"/> though he had béen a ſléepe: ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> things were after ſuch a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed maner, it might make the faithfull grone when as they ſee no helpe, and cauſe the wicked to run headlong into all licentiouſneſſe. Wherefore when there ariſe ſuch troubles in the worlde, and that we thinke ourſelues neuer a whit the better for the calling vpon God, hée is for the time as it were one that were loſt, and that had hid himſelfe. And contrariwiſe, by this reaſon, whenas God hath defended the cauſe of his Church, in deſtroying the enimies therof Dauid ſaith, that he aroſe vp. Howbeit S. Paule ſaith, That this was accompliſhed in the perſon of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe his maieſtie was darkened, and was had in no eſtimation of men for a ſeaſon. And therefore it was méete, ſaith hée, that he ſhoulde come downe on the earth, and bee contemned of men, that he might in the ende bée ſo exalted, as that he might not onely be ſimply and plainly honoured of men, but that he might alſo make a diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſpoiles and tributes. For where the Pſalmiſt ſaith, That he tooke the tributes which belonged vnto him, as vnto one who had brought his aduerſaries in ſubiection, S. Paule ſaith, that hée liberally beſtowed his gifts amongſt men. A man would think at the firſt ſight, theſe were things cleane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary one to another, and yet they right well agrée, becauſe our Lord Ieſus Chriſte was not inriched particularly for himſelfe, for he had no néed of any thing, but it was to this end, as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, to beſtow the ſpoyles on vs, ſo that not onely they which ſhould fight, ſhould haue parte of the bootie, but women alſo who neuer ſet one foote out of doores.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.13.</note> For, to ſay the trueth, we féele how God by the death &amp; paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, hath filled vs with his benefites: not for that there was any vertue or induſtry in vs: For we are of as litle force as women with their diſtaffs, when as we come to the fight. Wherefore, when it is ſaide in this place that GOD will giue to Ieſus Chriſt the booties of the enimies which he had conquered, as ſtrong &amp; mightie as they were, it was not only for himſelf, but it was to the end that we might vnderſtand, that the Diuell hath no title nor intereſt in vs whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>as we are partakers of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death &amp; paſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne of god: which we obtain by the mean of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel And therfore let vs without hipocriſy, ſubmit our ſelues vnto our Lord Ieſus, &amp; take him for our king: &amp; not doubt but that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt place hee will ſurely ſet vs frée, and beſides, that wée ſhall receiue from

               <p>Let vs now then conſider y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if Satan were not ſpoyled, how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable we ſhould bée: For he poſſeſſeth and peaceably inioyeth vs: For as our Sauiour Chriſte Ieſus ſaith:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iuke.</hi> 11.21.</note> we are euen as his own proper poſſeſſion and demaines. Wherefore wee had néede that the death and paſſion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte ſhoulde, bring foorth fruite in vs, and that our enimies being conquered, ſhoulde be eftſoones chaſed away, that Ieſus Chriſte ſhoulde ſo treade on their neckes, as that they ſhoulde neuer bée able to riſe againe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they went about to deuiſe to do all the miſchiefe they could againſt vs. And héere he namely ſpeaketh <hi>of ſtrong and great men</hi> to the ende wée ſhoulde not bée abaſhed at the force, munition, &amp; all the furniture of our enimies: For this were enough to feare vs, to ſée on the one ſide, our owne weakneſſe, and to know on the other ſide that the Diuell is like a roaring Lion,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Peter.</hi> 5.8.</note> and ſinne to haue domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ouer vs: this, I ſay, were euen enough to feare vs, except we were aſſured of this, that neither power, ſtrengthes, nor any thing els whatſoeuer, can let our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte from ſpoyling of all his enimies, from chaſing and bereauing of them of all they haue, ſo that which before was hurtfull vnto vs, ſhall now be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to our good and benefite. And this is not onely meant of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, the captaine of all the wicked, but alſo of all our Aduerſaries: For, looke how many faithleſſe people there are, euen ſo many fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryous enimies haue we againſt vs: and to make fewe words, wée ſée all the worlde almoſt on our toppes. And therefore what ſhoulde become of vs, if Ieſus Chriſte coulde not ouercome all the ſtrong and mightie ones of the earth? So then, we ſée héere in the firſt place what it is that we haue to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider of out of theſe words, That Ieſus Chriſt being aſcended, hath not onely held al our eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies captiue, but alſo hath made an vtter ſpoyle of them: and wée haue receiued all the giftes which were giuen him for homage, to the end we might be inriched by his liberalitie, being of our ſelues altogether poore and néedy.</p>
               <p>Nowe, it is namely ſaid, <hi>Becauſe hee hath powred out his ſoule to death.</hi> Whereby Iſaiah againe expreſſeth that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, of his owne frée will, offered vp himſelfe for theſe words, <hi>to poure out,</hi> ſignifieth, that he ſpared not himſelf, nor ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7663:147"/> for the matter. For hée that giueth with a good will, and in the ende ſlacketh his hande, maketh alwayes a ſhewe of ſparing. But hée that powreth out, ſheweth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he giueth luſtily, &amp; liberral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. So then, it is ſhewed vs, that our Lord Ieſus was ſo feruently inflamed with the loue of vs, as that his life guſhed out like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that hée became a willing Sacrifice, thereby to ſhew, that hee deſired nothing els, but for reconcilement vnto God his father. And this is alwaies for our greater confirmation, to the ende that when wée come vnto him, we ſhould neuer doubt but that he wold moſt gently and louingly receiue vs. For, how is it poſſible that he ſhould ſo reiect vs as members cut of from him, ſéeing hée ſo vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it were, forſooke himſelfe for our ſakes, and ſhed his precious heart blood. Wherefore, when we heare this, we are occaſioned to come more boldly vnto him, and to aſſure our ſelues that he at this day will make this Sacrifice, which hee ſo fréely offered vp vnto God his father of great effect by reaſon of the wonderfull loue hée bare to vs ward,</p>
               <p>Moreouer, forſomuch as the death and paſſion of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is perpetuall, let vs vnderſtand, that we are at this day inriched as much as is néedfull, as by experience we féele: For, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte muſt néedes helpe vs in all the diſtreſſes wherewith we are incompaſſed. For otherwiſe how ſhould we do, if his hand were not alwayes vpon vs to vphold vs? Surely it were impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for vs to ſtand. And therefore he alwaies giueth vs wherwith to relieue al our néedes and neceſſities. And to ſay the truth, al the graces of the holy Ghoſte are a part of the ſpoyle of our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte: For, God his father hath inriched him with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we might be as a man wold ſay, familiarly acquainted with them, and the Diuell wil ſtill bee a let that the power of the holy Ghoſt might not haue his courſe with vs: howbeit we are now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with them, in aſmuch as al lets are taken away: yea, and (as I haue alredy ſaid) that thing that was an hinderance vnto vs in this world, is nowe turned to our good and benefite, becauſe our Lorde Ieſus hath made a ſpoyle of all his enimies. Nowe, it is namely ſaid, <hi>Becauſe he was accounted amongſt ſinners, and bare the iniquities of many, and prayed for the treſpaſſers.</hi> We haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy heard, that our Lord Ieſus bare the tranſgreſſions of many: and that was becauſe he ſuſteined the puniſhment which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
<pb facs="tcp:7663:148"/> for vs to beare. And beſides, we were too too fraile &amp; weake to ſtand before the maieſtie of God, if we ſhould be burdened with our ſins: becauſe there is no meane in the whole world to be found to diſcharge vs of them. And therefore it was méete that our Lord Ieſus for the eaſing of vs ſhould preſent himſelfe in our ſtéede, &amp; be charged with our ſinnes, that they might be imputed vnto him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God his father, and hée be bound for the paiment of them. For, when a man ſhall onely owe a thing that hée is neuer able to pay, hée is like vnto one that were ſtiffe and croked, and knewe not which way to turne him, and hath ſuch a burden on his back, as it were, that ſo cruſheth &amp; bruiſeth his ſhoulders, as that it maketh him to ſtoupe again: what ſhal the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> become of vs, who are not debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to a mortall man, but euen vnto the liuing God? &amp; not debters of gold and ſiluer, but of our ſinnes, which deſerue as the ſcripture telleth vs his fearefull indignation. Thus we ſée howe the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of euerlaſting death was prepared for vs, vntill ſuch time as our Lord Ieſus Chriſt had diſcharged vs therof. And to ſay truly, how had we béen euer able to haue diſcharged it, except hée who had a moſt triumphant power ouer all creatures, had placed himſelfe in our ſtéed, and ſupplied our wants? Thus wée ſée howe our Lord Ieſus Chriſt bare the ſinnes and iniquities of many.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32.</note> Indeede this ſaying of many, is oftentimes taken for all. True it is that our Lord Chriſt offered vp himſelfe for all the worlde, for it is not ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by thrée or foure, when it is ſaid, God ſo loued the worlde that hée ſpared not his onely ſonne. But by the way, we muſt note, that which the Euangeliſt further ſaith in this place, That whoſoeuer beléeueth in him ſhold not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life. We ſée then that our Lord Ieſus Chriſte ſuffered for all, ſo that neither great nor ſmall can excuſe themſelues at this day, ſince by him we may be ſaued. And therefore the vnbeléeuers who by their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe turn a ſide, &amp; depriue themſelues héereof, are at this day twiſe guiltie. For what colour can they ſet in it to excuſe their vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they receiue not the benefit, wherof they might be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers through faith. Wherfore let vs heere learne, that although we ſhould come by heapes vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, one of vs ſhould be no let to another, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee is able to ſuffice euery of vs. Indéed if the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were to be holpen &amp; eaſed by a mortal man, it were another matter. For, if one ſhould come &amp; ſay, I beſéeche you
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7663:148"/> beare this burthen for mée and another ſay aſmuch, and ſo an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth at once: ſurely, although hée were very deſirous to helpe and eaſe them all, it could not be choſen but that they woulde make his ſhoulders crack: for, it were impoſſible for him to be of that ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth to beare al y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they would lay vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, And ſo likewiſe if the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were of borrowing, for put the caſe that they were hungry, and thirſtie, and ſhould goe to ſome man &amp; beſéech him to giue vs meat and drink, and it may bée that hée were well able to beſtow meat and drink of a doſen perſons: But if there ſhould come ſuch a great number as that his victualles ſhoulde faile him, wée ſhould ſée him come ſhort of his reckoning. So then, with vs me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is méete y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a great number haue néede, that there ſhoulde be alſo many to help and aide them: but when wée come to Ieſus Chriſt, wée neede not feare the want of his abilitie, for when euery man ſhall haue his portion, yet hath hée neuer a whit the leſſe, and others alſo ſhal find inough at his hands, for the moe of vs that come vnto him, the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher ſhall we finde him to help our néede. And therefore we haue héere to note, that it is not for naught that the prophet ſaieth, that he bare the ſinnes of <hi>many:</hi> to wit, to the ende we ſhould not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and enuy our neighburs, as if wée could not be holpen, bicauſe ſome of them haue to much of him. This then is the ſumme and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffect of that which we are to learne out of this place.</p>

               <p>Thus wee ſee how the ſhame of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted vs on hie, to the ende ſinne ſhould not be laide to our Charge, and we to be free from all condemnation. For, wherein conſiſted our ſaluation if our ſinnes were not couered and taken away? ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely we were neuer able to come to this by any other meane, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſonne of God as S.

And therfore it was not for naught that the Prophet ioyned theſe two thinges together: and dayly ſheweth vs, as héeretofore hath béene ſaide, that wée haue wherefore to gloryfie our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, in that he was put to all the ſhame that might bée, ſéeing the fruite and commoditie that wée reape thereby. For if our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt ſhould haue done that onely, for a ſhew and token of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytie, it had béene too too bare a matter: but hée did it to this end and purpoſe, that we might finde that in him, which we want, and that it might alſo be the remedy for the ſame thing which might gréeue and oppreſſe vs.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, when we are ſo reconciled vnto God, as that wée ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine righteouſneſſe thereby, and full forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, Beholde, wée néede not then be a feard to come vnto our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, albeit his crucifying in the view of the worlde, ſéemeth at the firſt bluſh, to bée very ſhamefull: and yet wée ſée, that hée ſo triumphed ouer Satan &amp; ſinne, as that he hath made vs righteous, and canceled the obligation that was againſt vs, ſo that wee may now come bouldly to God, with good aſſuraunce that wée are righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous: and with open mouth glorifie him for it, wherfore before we were moſt horribly condemned. And this is the effect of that which the Prophet meaneth, againe to put vs in minde of.</p>
               <p>After all theſe thinges, he ſaithe, <hi>that he praid for the treſpaſſers.</hi> This is namely put in, to ſhew that Ieſus Chriſt in his death and paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, plaid the part of a prieſt: for if this had not ben done alſo, we ſhuld neuer haue had al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> was requiſit for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And againe, where ſhoulde wee find ſuch an Aduocat and Proctor that would doe ſo much for vs, except we come to Ieſus Chriſte? Thus then we ſée what the Prophet meant to adde for a concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that which went before. To wit, that Ieſus Chriſt <hi>praied for the treſpaſſers.</hi> Now, this is very true, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he praied of god his father when he was on the Croſſe, that he would pardon and forgiue his perſecutors.

                     <hi>Luke.</hi> 23.34.</note> Here we ſée what a prayer our Lord Ieſus made for the treſpaſſers, &amp; for his enimies who ſo cruelly handeled him, &amp; by whoſe handes he was crucified. But it was not the meaning of the Prophet to ſpeake only of this eſpeciall prayer, but rather to declare the Sacrificing of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And by the way let vs here wel conſider, that it was not for naught that he ſpake here of the <hi>Treſpaſſers.</hi> It is ſaid a litle before, that he beare the ſinnes of the people of God, and ſuffered for the tranſgreſſions of many: But now the Prophet attributeth another name to thoſe for whom Chriſt praied, &amp; calleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors.</hi> When he ſpake of the people of God, it was to ſhewe that thoſe whom a man would thinke to be moſt excellent &amp; righteous, had néede of forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, which they could neuer haue had, had it not béen that Ieſus Chriſte had ſhed his moſt precious heart blood for the waſhing &amp; cleanſing of them. And thus muche then for this point: That if we would be of the Church, &amp; be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be of the congregation of God, we muſt néedes vnderſtand, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is becauſe Ieſus Chriſt is our redéemer, and therefore let vs not feare to come in great companies to him, &amp; rather then faile let e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one bring his neighbour with him, becauſe he is able to ſaue
<pb facs="tcp:7663:150"/> vs al. Moreouer, it is here ſet downe, that we are all tranſgreſſors to the end we might throughly conſider of our ſins: For we know our ſelues to be ſo bold and raſh, as that we will ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times be more ſhamefaſt &amp; ſober in requiring of any thing at the hands of amor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we wil be when we come before the Maieſtie of god. Now the Prophet, héere pulleth downe all the Peacocks plumbs, when he calleth vs tranſgreſſors: as if he ſhould haue ſaid, O you curſed &amp; wicked ones, what are you that dare preſume to cal vpon God by the name of father? Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence haue you this dignitie? What is he y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dareth once enterpriſe to come before the preſence of the Maieſtie of god, and ſay, I am one of thy children? Away (ſaith he) and goe hide your ſelues, for you are al malefactors, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming before God, you come before your Iudge, and therefore you ought to tremble &amp; be vtterly aſhamed. Howbeit the onely reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to aſſure your ſelues is this, that when you call vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of God, you haue an inuincible defenſe by the power &amp; interceſſion of the Mediatour. For without him there is no hope of your ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but are altogether dead in your ſinnes. And therefore vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand you, that you had néede haue the ſonne of God to be betwéene you &amp; him, &amp; to make interceſſion for you, by playing the Prieſtes part. We ſée then here why the Prophet namely calleth vs al treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſers &amp; tranſgreſſors, to wit, to the end we might know that the gate is ſhut vpon vs, &amp; are vnworthie to come neare vnto God: and that we are all oppreſſed &amp; confounded, if we run not to that help: For without this remedy, we muſt néedes periſh and rotte in our wretchednes and miſeries. Now, when we are thus humbled, then may we come to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, Becauſe we knowe that it is he that ſpeaketh for vs, &amp; that by him alſo wée may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call our ſelues the children of God. For when wée come to pray, &amp; ſay, O our father which art in heauen: we muſt néedes acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that our mouthes, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning our ſelues, are filthie, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not worthie once to call God, our Creator, &amp; it is ſo farre of in déede, as that we ought not to bee ſo preſumptuous as to take our ſelues for his children. And yet our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſpeaketh for vs,<note place="margin">Heb.</note> &amp; ſo by his mean our prayers &amp; ſupplications are ſanctified: For ſo it is ſaid in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, That by him it is by whom we render vnto god the ſacrifice of praiſe, &amp; all our praiers, and that he is our mediator, in whoſe name at this day, we cal vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7663:150"/> God our Father. And therefore wee may boldly glorifie our ſelues in that he will take vs for his children. Wée ſée then howe we are to put this place in practiſe. Now we ſée that our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath verified this, when he prayed for his, as appeareth in the Goſpell after S. Iohn, Looke vnto them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17.11.</note> holy Father which thou haſt giuen mée: for now I goe out of the world. Thoſe that thou gaueſt mée I haue kept, &amp; none of them is loſt, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loſt child: but thoſe whom thou gaueſt me in charge, haue I kept. Nowe I pray for them, &amp; not onely for them, but alſo for al thoſe which ſhal beléeue on me through their preaching, I pray not for the worlde, but for thoſe whom thou haſt giuen me, that thou wouldeſt bleſſe &amp; ſanctifie them, that they might alſo be one as we are. When then we ſee the ſonne of God pray: and ſée him alſo, who is God eternall, ſo to abaſe himſelf, as to become a peticioner, and offer vp his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication vnto God his father in our name: ſhould not we here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge an infinite goodneſſe? And wee are in the firſt place al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to conſider of that which hath gone before: to wit, that wée ſhall doe nothing els but prophane the name of God with calling vpon him, if we do it not in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, And why ſo? Forſooth, becauſe our mouthes are filthie &amp; vncleane: yea &amp; we our ſelues full of corruption: &amp; no better then ſtinking wormes: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Lord Ieſus Chriſt abaſed himſelfe euen vnto the ſtate of a Begger, &amp; to become a peticioner vnto god his father for vs: there ſhould be a ſure &amp; ſetled ſtaiednes in vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there ariſeth any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in the framing of our prayers at this day. It is true, that as the Prophet Iſaiah ſaith: that Ieſus Chriſt praied for the tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo likewiſe ſaith he himſelf y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he praied not for al the world for ſuch as take pleaſure in their iniquities, &amp; continue obſtinate, for ſuch men are quite &amp; cleane cut of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this benefite &amp; priueledge which is onely reſerued for the children of God. And therefore if we remain ſtill in the world, &amp; be ſeparated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Lord Ieſus Chriſt without doubt, no whit of the prayer which he made vnto God his father, apperteineth vnto vs, neither ſhall it doe vs any good: But let vs hearken to that which he ſaith, Behold,<note place="margin">

I pray for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaith he, and not onely for them (to wit the Diſciples) But alſo for all thoſe which ſhall beléeue their preaching. And therefore let vs at this day vnderſtande that wée are made companions with the Diſciples,
<pb facs="tcp:7663:151"/> and Apoſtles of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and that this prayer which hée once made, will very well ſerue our turnes, and leaue an open way for our prayers, ſo that we receiue the doctrine of the Goſpell, in faithful obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Wherfore we néed not now ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in doubt how to frame our petitions: For ſince we know that Ieſus Chriſt hath prayed, we haue no more to ſay, howe ſhall we be aſſured that the power of this prayer ſhall doe vs good? Forſooth, let vs beléeue the Goſpel, and then we ſhall follow the Apoſtles and Diſciples and be linked together with them. Would we make the ſonne of God a lyer, who is the euerlaſting and vnchangeable trueth? I thinke there is none that would. Now hee hath ſpoken it with his owne mouth, that all they that will receiue the preaching of the Goſpell, are linked to this prayer, and comprehended within it. Since then it is ſo, although on the one ſide wee are miſerable tranſgreſſors, and therefore not worthie to come néere vnto God, yet when we by the meane of the Goſpell, doe imbrace through faith the promiſes therein conteined, then may wée preſent our ſelues vnto the Lord, becauſe he wil not only accept vs, foraſmuch as his onely Sonne hath made interceſſion for vs, but that we may alſo at this day call vpon him, and be likewiſe, as hee himſelf ſaith, Companions with him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 8.18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.13.</note> for theſe are his wordes, Behold mee, and the ſeruants which thou haſt giuen mée. He offereth himſelfe héere in the firſt place (as hath already béen declared in the viii. Chapter) and then bringeth with him his whole company. Now it is ſaid, that hee, and all the company which were giuen vnto him, were there redy to worſhip God his Father. And therefore there is no doubt but that we ſhall all be linked together in this prayer, &amp; in all the prayſes &amp; thankes giuing vnto the Lord, and that Ieſus Chriſt doth as a man would ſay, powre out and become as it were, the chiefe chaunter, to bring vs into our prayers, ſo that by his meane the ſound of our voices do in ſuch ſort ioyne together, as that they make very ſwéet &amp; pleaſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t harmony. For, when we &amp; the Angels of heauen ſhal pray together to God, will not this be a moſt excellent priuiledge? But, when the ſonne of God wil vouchſafe to be ſo familiar w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs, as to ſay, come your wayes, &amp; I will be your ſpokes man, would not this meruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly rauiſh vs? Moreouer, his was figured in the Lawe when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the high Prieſt did not onely offer vnto God the Sacrifices, but ioined alſo with them prayers &amp; ſupplications. And therfore vnder the auncient ſhadowes, no Prieſt could make interceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto god,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:7663:151"/> and be made acceptable without the ſheading of blood: howbeit, hée ioyned alſo with blood prayers, that the ſinnes of the people might be forgiuen, and that God might receiue ſuch to mercy, as were worthie to be reiected. Thus we ſée that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath taken away the figures of the lawe, and hath fulfilled and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them in his owne perſon. That is, hée hath offred vp blood for the waſhing away of our ſinnes, not the blood of Calues,<note place="margin">Hebr. 9.14</note> and ſhéepe, as the maner was in the lawe, but euen his owne precious blood, which was conſecrated by the holie Ghoſt, to the ende wée might be wholly ſanctified by him. And yet hée ioyned prayers with the effuſion of blood. And therefore we ſée why at this day he is called our Mediatour, and maketh interceſſion for vs. And when Saint Paule ſpeaketh of prayers, hée ſaieth,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5.</note> That there is one God, and Mediatour, euen the man Ieſus Chriſt. Hée might verie well haue ſayde, There is one God, and one Ieſus Chriſt who is the eternall word of God, and of the ſelfe ſame eſſence, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and maieſtie.</p>
               <p>Nowe, hée vſeth not this kinde of ſpéech: But hée ſaieth, there is one God, and one Mediatour betwéene God and men, euen the man Ieſus Chriſt: As if hée ſhould haue ſayde,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.27. <hi>&amp;</hi> 9.7.</note> Behold the Sonne of God, who after hee had taken vpon him our nature, and was made man lyke vnto vs, ſinne except, maketh now interceſſion for vs. Nowe, the Prieſtes in the olde time, néeded to pray for them ſelues (and ſo they did) and for the ſinnes of all the people, in which number they were alſo comprehended. But our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus as touching him ſelfe, néeded not ſo to doe: neither is there any cauſe why he ſhould for his parte, craue pardon for any ſinnes that hée had committed: but maketh interceſſion for vs.<note place="margin">Rom. <hi>8.</hi>31</note> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Saint Paule would enbolden vs to come vnto God, hée namely ſaith, If God be on our ſide, who ſhall be againſt vs? For, although we haue many enemies, yet let vs not be afeard: and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom muſt we yéeld an account of the beſtowing of our whole life? Who alſo is our Iudge? Forſooth, euen the man Ieſus Chriſt, and he him ſelfe alſo is our Aduocate, to make interceſſion, and an agréement betwéene God and vs. It is euen he that muſt obtayne grace for vs. Wherfore we may with good courage come before the maieſtie of God, yea, &amp; boldly preſent our ſelues before his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat, ſince we haue Ieſus Chriſt to ſtand there betwéene him
<pb facs="tcp:7663:152"/> and vs.</p>
               <p>Thus then we ſée what is the effect of that which we haue to conſider of, when as this ſaying of interceſſion is here ſpoken of. To be ſhort, as often as the death and paſſion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt is talked of, let vs ioyne theretoo eftſoones the prayer which he made once for all, to the ende it might remaine for euer, and woorke his effect: For it is not nowe needfull for our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt to kneele on his knees before God his Father, to pray vnto him: In deede it is ſaide, that he will make alwayes interceſſion for vs. But howe? Forſooth, euen by the power of his death and paſſion, and by the prayer that is made at this day. For, through the power thereof we are heard, as if he him ſelfe at this day ſpake for vs, and beſides (as I haue ſaide) all our prayers are ſanctified by him, otherwiſe they ſhould be but prophane. And to ſay truely, as often as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithfull prepare themſelues to pray vnto God, They (where the Papiſts ſprinkle holy water, as they call it, about, and charme &amp; coniure, or rather maſk &amp; mumme) ſhould féele that their praiers are beſprinckled with the blood of Ieſus Chriſt, to the ende they might be pure and cleane, and that God might receiue them as a ſwéete ſmelling ſacrifice. And herevpon, let vs vnderſtande that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt was not a ſacrificing Prieſt for a day onely, but kéepeth that office ſtill euen vnto this day, and for euer, that we might alwayes féele the fruit therof. Now, if this had been rightly knowne, men woulde not haue exceeded (as hath come to paſſe) in ſo many villainies &amp; ſuperſtitions. For, we ſée howe the Papiſts at this day wander about lyke miſerable ſtray beaſts, not knowing which way or path to take, to pray vnto God. For they haue an infinite number of Patrones and Aduocates, and euerie man buildeth vpon his owne Patrone and Aduocate. In déede, they haue many common and ordinarie ones, but yet after al their kyries (as they ſay) euerie man will ſay his deuotions to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Saint which he hath forged vnto him ſelf. Thus we ſee how Ieſus Chriſt is robbed of his honour and glorie. And this is out of all doubt, that when they are not contented with Ieſus Chriſte, it muſt bee that the Deuill hath poſſeſſed them, and put them in ſuch a furie, as it were, to deſpight God, who ſpeaking of Ieſus Chriſt in giuing him that office, they haue giuen the right of it to this bodie &amp; that.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7663:152"/> As the Papiſtes as this day, call the virgine Marie their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatrix. Nowe, the Deuill goe with all their prayers: For this is as much as if they forſooke God, and our lord Ieſus Chriſt. And it cannot be choſen but that the virgine Mary her ſelfe cryeth out for vengeance againſt them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5.45.</note> becauſe they haue made a deteſtable Idoll of her, and robbed Ieſus Chriſt of the honour of this ſacrifice, ratefied by God with a ſolemne oth: and haue done all they can to falſefie the whole ſcripture. The Papiſtes think that the virgine Mary will help them, but ſhée will rather (as I haue alredie ſaide) call for vengeance againſt them, for the wrong which they haue done her: For, if they ſhould ſpit on her, &amp; do her all the villainies that were poſſible to be done, without doubt, they could not deuiſe to do her a greater ſhame, then to call her a Mediatrix. And why ſo?<note place="margin">

               <p>Here then we ſée whervpon we ſhould lay our foundation, to wyt, vpon the interceſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, becauſe (as Saint Paule ſaieth to the Epheſians) we may come neare vnto God,<note place="margin">

Now, what would the Papiſts doe? Forſooth, euen make the ſacrifice of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt of none effect, and to be nothing at all. And when they will come with ſuch a Deuiliſh boldneſſe as to ouerthrow the vnchaungeable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crée of God, how can they hope any way to be heard? Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude, that all this doctrine was cleane buried in Poperie. And why ſo? Verely, I know they will ſay, that we are vnworthy to come before the Maieſtie of God, That is verie true, and who doubteth thereof? But let vs conſider by the way, where it is that we muſt ſéeke for our dignitie, muſt we not ſéeke it in Ieſus Chriſt alone? And yet will they runne, to the virgine Mary, to Saint Michaell, and to the Apoſtles: and beſides, they will haue their Saintes of their owne deuiſing, whiche were neuer heard of in the whole worlde before, or elſe whiche were canonized at the Popes pleaſure, euen in the bottome of hell. Loe,
<pb facs="tcp:7663:153"/> here are their goodly Patrons and Aduocates. But, let it be that wée graunted the Papiſtes all this, That their Saints which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer were, or els which were half Deuils, &amp; phantaſticall ſpirites, had béene Apoſtles and Martyres, and had liued as holily as were poſſible, had not they, I beſéech you, as great néede of a Medya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor as the reſt. This is moſt certaine, that the Virgine Marie could not finde grace before the Maieſtie of God, without the head and principall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was as néedfull for her that Ieſus Chriſt ſhould be her Redéemer, as well as oures. The Apoſtles, Martyres, Patryarches,<note place="margin">Mat. <hi>11.</hi>28</note> and Prophetes, had alſo the ſelfe ſame néed to runne vnto this common Redéemer of all men. And what ſhall we doe when we goe about to ſéeke him? Wherefore, forſomuch as the Apoſtles doe ſende vs vnto Ieſus Chriſt, and haue tolde vs that it is hée that muſt be our guide and ſtay, and who inuiteth vs ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uingly, ſaying, Come vnto mée, &amp;c. Let vs not draw backward, nor royle abroade, but boldly drawe néere vnto him. For, hée ſpake not theſe woordes onely for the behoofe of the Apoſtles, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyres, or for the Virgine Mary, But his meaning was to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vs all with him ſelfe, as in déede it is moſt neceſſarie for vs. Let vs, I ſay, learne not to wander too and fro when we pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and let vs alſo vnderſtande what a good turne hée hath done vs, when as it hath pleaſed him to draw vs from out of this bottomleſſe confuſion of Poperie, and ſheweth vs an open plaine way to come vnto him, to wit, Becauſe Ieſus Chriſt is our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſour.</p>
               <p>Let vs reſt our ſelues there, without turning either to the one ſide or yet to the other. For this is out of all doubt, that if our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be not ordered and ſquared according to the worde of God they are altogether vayne and of none effect, and God vtterly reiecteth them: and beſides, they can not be made in Fayth, without the certaintie of them procéedeth from the trueth of God. Now then if wée would build our Prayers vpon fayth, they muſt be agréeable vnto the worde of God, and wée muſt followe that which hée com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth vs: and that is, wee muſt take Ieſus Chriſt for our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſour, Aduocate, and Mediator. Thus wée ſée what a proppe it is which hée giueth vs, and what the foundation is wherevpon wée muſt ſtay our ſelues, that we might not be ſhaken like Réedes with euerie winde.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecauſe wée are too buyld our faith vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon God and his truth, S. Luke héere telleth vs, that Ieſus Chriſt ſent not his Apoſtles to teach what they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues thought good: But put his word into their mouthes, and gaue them ſure and certaine inſtruction, to the end they might carrie ſuch a faithfull meſſage, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wee might take no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to doubt thereof. And therefore, when as we at this day heare the Goſpel preached, we ought to be fully reſolued, that it is the charge which God committed vnto his Apoſtles, and receiue it as the thing which commeth from himſelf, as indéede it doeth.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, to the end we ſhould beare greater reuerence vnto the Goſpel, it is not ſaid only that Ieſus Chriſt deliuered it, but that it was alſo done <hi>by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> For as Ieſus Chriſt is the very natural Sonne of God, euen ſo likewiſe is he man, and hath taken vpon him our fleſhe and nature. Nowe vnder this ſhadowe (as no doubt of it, the worlde is wicked) a man might vnder a colour take occaſion to contemne this doctrine, or els not make ſo greate an account of it. Here then we ſée that Saint Luke ſaith, that the charge which was geuen vnto the Apoſtles to teach, procéeded not from Ieſus Chriſt alone, but from the holie Spirite alſo. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wée at this preſent ſée, that the preaching of the Goſpell, is heauenly, and not earthly, and ratified, by God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, wée muſte alſo obſerue, that the ſumme and effect of the Goſpel is comprehended in theſe fewe woordes, to wit, <hi>That Ieſus Chriſte both taught and made it:</hi> So that if
<pb facs="tcp:7663:155"/> we will beare the name of Chriſtians, we muſt be taught that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which Ieſus Chriſt brought vs: and beſides, be alſo eftſoones confirmed therein. For he hath not onely ſpoken, but hath likewiſe accompliſhed whatſoeuer was neceſſary for our ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, becauſe his death and reſurrection was of al the reſt, the moſt principall poynt, wée haue therefore ſpoken of it in order, as it followeth, S. Luke then ſaith, that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt, after he had ſuffred, ſhewed himſelfe aliue vnto his Diſciples:</hi> and that, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny manifeſt proofes, which was not without good cauſe: For when wée heare the promiſes of God ſpoken on, our faith wil ſtill hang in ſuſpence, vntil ſuch time as we are aſſured of his grace and fauour: which can neuer be, without the gage which he hath geuen vs: to wit, that Ieſus Chriſt ſuffered for our redemption, &amp; beare the puniſhment due for our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Thus héere wée ſée that Saint Luke ſpeaketh not in vaine of the proofes which were giuen to aſſure vs that Ieſus Chriſt is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen againe.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.14</note> For harken what Saint Paul ſaieth, that if Chriſt be not riſen, our faith is in vaine, and our Preaching alſo in vaine, wée haue no more hope then very Beaſtes. By this we ſée, that the ende of our hope is, that Ieſus Chriſt is ryſen from the dead. And this is the victory indéed which he hath gotten: yea, euen to ſhew that he is Lorde ouer lyfe and death.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.15</note>Saint Paul alſo ſaith, that Ieſus Chriſt dyed for our ſinnes: and if hée had remayned dead ſtill, what hope might wée haue had by him? but beholde hée roſe agayne, &amp; that is the triumph which he had ouer death, to the end we might beléeue in him.</p>
               <p>Saint Peter likewiſe to ſhew, that wée ought to beléeue in Ieſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Peter</hi> 3.21.</note> bringeth for proofe héereof none other thing but his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Let vs therefore obſerue, that when Saint Luke ſayeth, that Ieſus chriſt ſhewed himſelfe aliue, he ſpeaketh of a thing that was requiſit for the aſſurance of our ſaluation. Wherefore, if wée woulde haue the principall poynt of Chriſtianitie, wée muſt come to this reſurrection, by which hee purchaſed for vs lyfe and ſaluation, and ſhewed himſelfe to bée the very Sonne of God.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, let vs alſo learne, that ſince Saint Luke ſaieth, that Ieſus Chriſt hath made vs ſuch proofes of his reſurrection, let vs not call that thing into queſtion, which God himſelfe hath ſo well approued.</p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:7663:155"/>
               <p>And therefore if we are not at this day fully perſuaded, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is riſen agayne, let vs thanke our owne vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.</p>
               <p>Saint Luke alſo vſeth a kinde of ſpéech, which a fourdeth an argument that bringeth with it a preſent proofe. And in deed, we ſée what payne the Euangeliſtes haue taken in this matter. For, when they come to ſpeake of the reſurrection, they lay foorth all the circumſtaunces, and beſides, they recyte all the teſtimonies of his wordes, for hée hath ſaide, and declared that it was no vaine ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination or viſion, whereby ſome trouble might afterward ariſe. And therefore, wée ought to vnderſtande and knowe, that ſince they haue taken ſo great paynes héerein, that wée muſt not ſtande in doubt of it, but it is fit wée ſhould receiue their wordes as ſure and certaine, ſéeing they bring ſo good a proofe with them. And therefore, for this matter, whereof Saint Luke ſpeaketh, that Ieſus Chriſt ſhewed him ſelfe a lyue, after hée had béen dead, with ſo manifeſt and many proofes, wée muſt learne to build vpon ſuch a foundation as ſhall neuer be able to be ſhaken. And as he hath thus ouercome death, euen ſo doeth hée now ſtretch foorth his hand to guide and bring vs to ſaluation. And ſo often, as wée would aſſure our ſelues of our ſaluation, wée muſt not runne vnto Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but let vs behold as it were in a glaſſe, that as Chriſt Ieſus is riſen againe, and hath ouercome death, euen ſo alſo hath he ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the kingdome of heauen, that we might enter into it vnder his charge.</p>
               <p>It is further ſaide, that when hée ſhewed him ſelfe, <hi>That hee ſpake of the kingdome of God,</hi> amongſt his friendes. Wherein wee are to note, that the Commiſſion which was graunted vnto theſe, from whom we receiue the doctrine of the Goſpell, was not ſet downe in a worde, or for a minute of an houre, but, that they were, ſo ſufficiently inſtructed, for a long while, and that they haue not inſtructed vs at randon, not knowing what they meant, but were taught and inſtructed as they ſhoulde bée. And when they had, thus fully and wholly receiued this doctrine, and therewithall authoritie to beſtow it, they haue deliuered the ſame faythfully vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſée what wée haue to note in this ſaying. Nowe,
<pb facs="tcp:7663:156"/> it is ſaide, that Ieſus Chriſt ſhewed him ſelfe vnto his Apoſtles, and in ſhewing him ſelfe, <hi>Hee ſpake of the kingdome of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them.</hi> But héere we are to vnderſtande, what it is that Saint Luke meaneth by the kingdome of God: hée meaneth not by this kingdome of God, euerlaſting life, as we commonly take it, and as at the firſt ſight, it might here be taken, as who ſhoulde ſay, That, that, is the kingdome of God, which we wayte for, through hope. But Saint Luke taketh it to bee the ſpirituall gouernment, by whiche Ieſus Chriſte holdeth vs in his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, vntill hée hath wholly refourmed vs vnto his owne Image, and hauing diſpoyled vs of this mortal body, ſendeth vs to heauen. And this is the very meaning of S. Luke: But to make the matter more eaſie and plaine, let vs take the kingdome of God cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie: and that is this, the life of men, which follow their corrupt nature. And in déede, if Ieſus Chriſt ſhould goe from vs, and let vs goe whether we liſted our ſelues, ſurely we ſhould be quite &amp; clean out of the kingdome of God. For by the kingdom of God, is meant a reformation: and we bring nothing with vs but miſeries &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in this worlde: to be ſhort, we are wandring beaſts, and the Deuill ruleth vs, and ſo, thralleth vs, euen as it pleaſeth him ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Thus, we ſée what man is, vntill God hath refourmed him. Wherefore, let vs take out this leſſon, to know what wée are, vntill ſuch time as Ieſus Chriſt hath refourmed vs. Why then? would we haue a greater miſchiefe then this, as to haue Satan ſo to poſſeſſe vs, and to be our Maiſter? And thus, I ſay, we ſée what we are, vntill ſuch time as God of his infinite goodneſſe, ſtretcheth foorth his hande vnto vs, euen to bring vs into his kingdome, that we might be obedient vnto him, and to his iuſtice. Nowe, by the way, we are alſo to ſée, howe highly we ought to eſtéeme of this grace when it is offred vs, and that Ieſus Chriſt draweth vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. And loe here is all our bleſſedneſſe, that God is our King. In déed, although Kings couet to haue kingdomes to encreaſe their honour and wealth, and to be Lordes ouer nations, without any regard to a better ende, yet if any Prince be endued with excellent graces, euerie man will think him ſelfe bleſſed that is his ſubiect. But when Ieſus Chriſt reigneth ouer vs, we haue a king y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is not onely endued with many excellent graces, but alſo who reigneth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7663:156"/> vs for our benefit. And to ſay the trueth, he is no whit bettered by vs: for we can no more encreaſe, then we can diminiſh.<note place="margin">Pſal. 16.2.</note> Thus we ſée, that the thing which I haue alredie ſaid, is very true, That we are bleſſed, when as God ſetteth vp his kingly throne amongſt vs, to reigne ouer vs. Here we ſée what we are taught in the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d place, to wit, to eſteeme and make muche, of ſuch a benefite when God beſtoweth it vpon vs: now, the meane commeth by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpel. We alſo ſée, why Ieſus Chriſt ſpake ſo oftentimes of the Goſpel,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.24.31.33.44.45.</note> calling it the kingdome of God: For if we ſticke not to it, we are verie rebelles to God, and baniſhed from all his graces: For wée ſhall neuer haue parte of them, vntill we be refourmed. Which thing the Goſpell worketh by calling vs to Ieſus Chriſt, and ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing vs that we muſt be regenerate by his holie ſpirite. Since then it is ſo, when the Goſpel is preached, it is to the end we might bée lyke vnto Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; forſake whatſoeuer is in our ſelues, that we might be rayſed vp agayne by his grace: And therefore the Goſpell is not called the kingdome of God without good cauſe. And in déede, as without it the Deuill reigneth, and by reaſon therof is called the King of this world: Euen ſo when Ieſus Chriſt cauſeth his Goſpell to be preached in any countrie, it is as much as if hée ſhoulde ſay, I will reigne ouer you and be your King: But yet it cannot be ſaide, that all they which dwell in that countrie where the Goſpell is preached, doe obey God: For we ſée ſome of them lift them ſelues vp, and ſhewe foorth their iniquitie which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laye hid in them: and otherſome contemne the doctrine, in whom is no fruite of the kingdome of God. And yet Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus hath alwayes a little congregation, where the Goſpel is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. And howe ſo? Forſooth, becauſe there is no King, but hath ſubiectes.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, wée may conclude, that it is an ineſtimable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite, when GOD offreth vs his Goſpell. For what would wée more, then when our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt ſayeth vnto vs. Loe héere I am: and take charge of you, to the ende you might bée vnder my winges and protection, nowe, what can you deſire more? Wée knowe then that all this commeth vnto vs by the Goſpell. And this is the perfection of all our happineſſe, if wée could rightly vnderſtand it.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7663:157"/>
               <p>Moreouer, this is certaine, that when Ieſus Chriſt thus brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vs into his kingdome, and taketh vs vnto him ſelfe, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hée woulde cloth vs ſo much the rather with immortalitie &amp; incorruption, to the ende wée might enter into his promiſed glory And therfore when we receiue this Goſpel, we enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God. But what? This is only but an entraunce, howbeit we muſt go on a great deale further into it: which thing is brought to paſſe, when as he deliuereth vs from this curſed bondage of ſin, and ſetteth vs at the libertie which he promiſed vs. Thus wée ſée, that it is not enough to haue an entraunce, but wée muſt goe ſtill forwarde, vntill ſuch time as wee are wholly vnited vnto Ieſus Chriſt. And in déede, we knowe, that although God enlightneth vs with his holie ſpirite, and we haue a deſire to walk in his feare, and acknowledge his goodneſſe wherevnto wee truſt, yet are our infirmities ſo many as is lamentable, and we are to fight againſt a number of temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, wherwith we are oftentimes ouercome. What ſhall become then of all this geare? Is it enough that wée haue entred? No, no: But wée muſt vnderſtande that our lyfe, is a way, and we muſt ſtill be going on, vntill wee be come vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. And ſo muſt the kingdome of God, more and more encreaſe, vntill wée are quite rydde of ſinne: For wée daily haue experience enough héereof, although we are a great way of, from being vnited to God as we ought. Wherefore, this is a token that God reigneth not in vs as hée ſhoulde: For if he did, all our power and force woulde bende it ſelfe that way. Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, wée féele euen as great rebellion as may be, when as wée woulde goe about to doe that whiche God teacheth vs. Séeing then we in ſuch ſort ſtande againſt God and his iuſtice, it is a ſigne that hée ruleth not vs peaceably: For, all that euer we haue, euen without our bellies, as we ſay, ſhould goe that way, that the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God might appeare and ſhine throughout. Contrariwiſe, we ſée that there is nothing in vs, euen from the toppe to the toe, but horrible rebellion.</p>

Wherefore, we are admoniſhed to goe on, vntill ſuch time as God is all in all: to wyt, we ſhould be ſo full of him, as that we ſhould be emptie of our ſelues: namely, we ſhoulde be vncloathed of this bodie, &amp; be rayſed vp into that glory which is promiſed vs.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:7663:157"/>
               <p>The ſpéech then which our Lord Ieſus Chriſt had with his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of the kingdome of God, tended to this end, that wée ſhoulde forſake our ſelues, and ouerthrow whatſoeuer is oures, and that Ieſus Chriſt might ſet vp his Throne, and guide vs, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we might be altogether agréeable vnto his righteouſnes, &amp; ſeeke only to folow him as our ſoueraigne and liege Lord &amp; King. And all this is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to vs. Why ſo? Forſooth, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles were not taught onely for them ſelues, but for vs. And therefore let this be a note vnto vs, that whenſoeuer the Goſpel is deliuered vnto vs, it is to this end that we ſhould be readie to leaue this world: to wit, al the wicked affections, and vanities that are in vs, which kéepe vs back here below: For we muſt be wholly chaunged, &amp; God muſt giue vs a new life. Thus we ſée how it is, that the Goſpell muſt doe good, to the end it might be indéed the verie kingdome of God, &amp; beare ſuch authoritie with vs as is méete. And by the way, God calleth vs not vnto him, meaning to kéepe vs alwayes in one ſtate, but will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually pricke vs on, vntill he hath brought vs to perfection, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vs to vnderſtande that this preſent life is like a Sea full of all miſeries: thus we ſée howe Ieſus Chriſte bendeth him ſelfe to bring vs vnto the heauenly kingdome, after we are once entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdome of God in this world. It is ſaide, <hi>That he forbad them going from Ieruſalem,</hi> vntill ſuch time as they had receiued the promiſe of God. And all this was ſpoken for the building vp of our Fayth: For we ſée howe neceſſarie it is for vs to be aſſured and reſolued of this point: to wyt, that men, deuiſed not the doctrine of the Goſpell, but that God ſent it from heauen. And therfore this ought to be put out of all doubt. What would then become of it, if it were not throughly declared and verified vnto vs, that Ieſus Chriſt in ſuch ſort ſent his Apoſtles, and were not ledde by their owne motion, counſell, or will, but ſent by God, who taught them their leſſon, and vnderſtood not of their owne witts this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, but by the holie Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>And therefore the wordes of Saint Luke are here to bée well marked, that hée handled this doctrine oftentimes amongſt them, to the ende they might be the better inſtructed therein, and not runne at randon. Ouer and beſides this, it is ſaide, that they muſt néedes be enlightened with the holie Ghoſt, that they might bée quite voide of all worldly wiſedome, and that it might be knowne
<pb facs="tcp:7663:158"/> that their doctrine was the verie word of God.</p>
               <p>Let vs therfore marke this well, that our Fayth may alwayes cleaue vnto God, as a faſt Anker holde: For wée ſhall finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Creatures, but ſhall flyt away lyke water, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it were an yll foundation to builde our Fayth on them: but when we ſhall builde it vpon God, it ſhall not be ſubiect to réele this way and that, but ſhall ſtande faſt and ſure. And héere wée ſée why the Apoſtles were forbidden to departe from Ieruſalem, vntill they had receiued the holie Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Nowe, by this, we ſée their obedience: For, in mans reaſon, they might haue ſomewhat replyed and ſaide, What? Are not we the Apoſtles of God? haue not we authoritie to preach his worde? Are not we able to execute our charge? They had ſome ſhewe why they might thus haue ſaide. For to what purpoſe had God iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them in this charge, without they might doe it? But they knew well enough that it was he whom they muſt obey, For curſed is that man who truſteth in him ſelfe to doe any worke, before God putteth him forwarde to doe it. And contrariwiſe, when God ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him, hée muſt not ſtriue againſt it, but ſay, Loe here am I Lorde, employ mée as pleaſeth thée. And thus we ſée howe Saint Luke ſheweth, that the Apoſtles obeyed Ieſus Chriſt, when as he forbad them to depart from Ieruſalem, vntill ſuche time as God had perfourmed his promiſe vnto them. And herein we ſée that the grace of the holy Ghoſt had alredie wrought in them: For not long before, they were clean out of the way, they had forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, they knew nothing what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aſſiſtance &amp; ſauegard of God ment: and ſuffred Satan to diſperſe them abroad. But what? when as God had once graunted them the grace to vnderſtande his voyce and meaning, hée néeded not but to haue beckened his finger, and they woulde haue obeyed him. And if he had forbidden them any thing, they would not haue attempted it: But contrariwiſe when he commaunded them to goe, neither fyre nor water coulde ſtaye them. Thus then wee ſée that it is God whiche muſt worke in vs, to bring vs vnto ſuch a ſubiection. For els, when he would ſay, retyer, we would goe on, and when he woulde byd vs march on,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Num.</hi> 14.3.<hi>40.</hi>
                  </note> we woulde goe backe. Nowe, héere we ſée what our nature is. And this notable myrror haue wee euen in the Iewes. For if we reade howe they behaued them ſelues, after they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7663:158"/> out of Egypt, wée ſhoulde there ſée their wonderfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe. For, when God commaunded them to goe againſt their enemies, and promiſed them that they ſhould haue victorie, they woulde not goe on, but murmured againſt him. Why, ſay they, whether ſhoulde wée goe? It ſhoulde ſéeme that hée goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to deſtroy vs, and to ſende vs lyke ſhéepe to the Butcherie. Loe ſuch was their rebellion.</p>
               <p>Contrariwiſe, when God ſaide, ſtirre not: they would néedes march on, and would not be ſtaide. What? (ſay they) wee looſe time, why march we not forwarde? Héere we ſée, howe that wée will march, when God ſayeth we ſhall not, againe, when he ſaieth march on, there is no man that will ſtep one foote forward. To be ſhort, it ſéemeth we woulde endeuour our ſelues to gainſay God, Loe, here our dealing. Surely we are much of the boldneſſe of mad men: For they are ſtrong, and a mad man will be ſtrong enough both to kill him ſelfe, and others. For when God woulde retire vs, we are madde, and would make hauocke of all thinges, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, when God would haue vs march on, we are ſo ſlack, as that euerie finger is a thumbe. And therfore we are to beſéech the Lord, to graunt vnto vs the lyke grace that hée gaue vnto his Apoſtles, that we ſtay when he commaundeth vs to ſtay, and march on whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hée biddeth vs. Thus we ſée, why hée hath appointed to euery one his ſeuerall office and charge. When he ordeined houſholdes, hée declared what authoritie the man ſhould haue ouer his wife, and family, and what the womans obedience was vnto the huſbande, and the childrens to the Parentes, ſo, hée ordeined a lawe for eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one. And to the ſame purpoſe and effect was his ordinaunce, for the adminiſtration of Ciuill gouernment. For, hée declared vnto Magiſtrates, what their duetie was, and howe they ought to vſe the authoritie committed vnto them: and to the Miniſters of his worde likewiſe, hée ſet downe a leſſon in writing. Thus wée ſée that Ieſus Chriſt hath ſo well ordered vs,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.25.</note> as that if we haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny regarde vnto him, we will attempt nothing, which hée com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth vs not. We ſée alſo the ſaying of Saint Paule, That whatſoeuer is not of Fayth is ſinne. Nowe, if God leaueth vs in doubt of any thing that we haue to doe, we cannot but continually ſinne: and therfore he hath ſet downe a rule vnto vs what we ſhal doe, and what we ſhall not doe.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7663:159"/>
               <p>Wherfore, let vs looke well that we be ruled by him, and attempt nothing, on our owne fooliſh braine.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, we ſée that the Apoſtles ſtaied in Ieruſalem, becauſe Ieſus Chriſt had ſo willed them: yea, although they knewe that God had ordeined them to that calling. And although Ieſus Chriſt had giuen them the holie Ghoſt by breathing vpon them, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they might very well know, that they were not as yet fenced as was méete,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 26.22.</note> but looked for the promiſe of the Father. This promiſe (as wée ſhall héereafter ſée) was the holie Ghoſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wayted they? forſooth, it was euen for vs.</p>
               <p>Wée ſée then héere, that although Ieſus Chriſt was aſcended into heauen, yet that hée had care of vs, &amp; helpeth vs from thence: neither is hée ſo farre from vs, but that hée keepeth vs companie, and gouerneth vs by his grace. And héere wée ſée why S. Luke ſayeth, that hée was taken vp into heauen, after that hée had by his holie ſpirite giuen commaundement to his Apoſtles whom hée had choſen. And hée went not thus away without thinking of vs. Howe then? Forſooth, hée gaue a charge vnto his Apoſtles, and ſhewed them, howe they ſhoulde gouerne them ſelues, after they had receiued the holie Ghoſt. And now wée haue héere a pledge, that wée ſhall neuer want his helpe, ſo that wée ſticke vnto him. Moreouer, this is one notable comfort for vs, that Ieſus Chriſt béeing aſcended into heauen, hath all power and authoritie in his owne hande, and is aboue all Creatures, becauſe hée is made Gods Lieutennaunt, to the ende hée might rule all thinges both in heauen and in earth.</p>
               <p>Nowe, that wée might make our profite by this, let vs marke, that although God hath ſo highly exalted Ieſus Chriſt, as that all Creatures are ſubiect vnto him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16.17.18.</note> yet is hée our head, and that this his great rule and Empire, is all for our benefite, if ſo be we are his members: But hée can not be our head, without we be true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnited vnto him. This then is the full aſſuraunce of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: which is, that becauſe Ieſus Chriſt is aſcended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and ruleth all thinges, inſomuch that the verie Angels are his ſubiectes: both they and all the reſt of the Creatures, ſhoulde miniſter to vs herein.</p>
               <p>And againe, hée ſo faſt and ſure holdeth in the Deuilles, as that they can doe nothing without his leaue.</p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:7663:159"/>
               <p>Wherefore, we are aſſured that they can doe vs no hurt. And why ſo? Forſooth, becauſe they were not able any way to ſtand againſt him.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, wée muſt ioyne this glorious power, with that knowledge which wée héere haue: not as though it was doone but for that preſent, but the power thereof extendeth it ſelfe euen vnto vs, becauſe it reacheth ouer heauen and earth. Nowe, this wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth vnto vs, that hée is with vs, whenas wée vnderſtande his word: becauſe hée hath ſo promiſed, and hée vſeth not to lye as men doe. Thus wée ſée howe ſure wée are of his preſence, and wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend vs by his holy ſpirite. For els what ſhould become of vs? Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing woulde make vs quaile: becauſe wee are as fraile as is poſſible. Contrariwiſe, wée ſée howe the Diuell, is armed at all pointes againſt vs. And therfore it is néedefull that God ſhoulde aſſiſt vs with his holy ſpirite, that wée might withſtande all his forces. Wée ſée then that although the body of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte bée farre from vs, yet are wée néere him through his power and might, which thing hée ſheweth vs in the Supper, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are to apply this doctrine to our ſelues. For the bringing of which to paſſe, wée muſt not approch vnto him as many doe, which come vnto him like beaſtes, but let vs vnderſtand what it is that is there giuen vs. When wée ſee God giue vs foode for our bodies it is a great bleſſing: But wée come not thither to fill our paun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Why ſo? Becauſe it ſignifieth vnto vs, that wée ought not to ſéeke for our bodily ſuſtenance therein. For as Saint Paule ſaith,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.<hi>22</hi>
                  </note> Wée haue houſes to eate and drinke in: and therefore wée came not hither to fill our bellies. Wherefore then? Forſooth, it is a teſtimonie that Ieſus Chriſte will féede our ſoules. What? ſhall our ſoules bee fed with bread and wine? No, no, that is not the meaning. For there is nothing wherewith they can bée fed, but with Ieſus Chriſte, For they muſt bee mainteined with euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life, which the Angels themſelues cannot giue. For as they had no being from eternitie, ſo alſo may they haue an ende. And therefore, wée muſt conclude that there is but one Father of life, which is Ieſus Chriſt. Wherefore wée come to ſéeke him in the Supper, and euery one that commeth muſt haue this ſetled mind, to bée able to ſay, I come hyther to haue a teſtimony that Ieſus Chriſte is my life, that being incorporate into him, I might liue
<pb facs="tcp:7663:160"/> for euer. But after what ſort come wée to finde him in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? If wée come after the manner of the Papiſtes to find the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our Lord Ieſus, we deceiue our ſelues: For that is the moſte curſed Idolatrie that may bée, to thinke the bread that we receiue there, to bée the body of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. Wée muſte therfore ſéeke for him aboue: and although we know him to be in heauen, yet doubt we not but that he is with vs by his grace: inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, that euen as we ſée and touch the ſignes, ſo likewiſe doth Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte accompliſh in vs the thing which the ſignes repreſent vnto vs: to wit, that he dwelleth in our ſoules. And although by nature our ſoules are in déede dead, by reaſon of our ſinnes, yet wil he make vs partakers of this euerlaſting life. For, as he ſaith, This bread preſenteth vnto you my body, euen ſo doth he truly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the ſame in our ſoules: and as our bodies are ſuſteined with bread, euen ſo our ſoules receiuing Ieſus Chriſt for a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all foode, are preſerued by the power of God, and hee remaineth in vs by his grace. Howbeit héere is not al, to haue vnderſtoode thus much: but we muſt alſo lift vp our mindes vnto heauen, for els we ſhould neuer be vnited to Ieſus Chriſte. No doubt of it there are many which know well enough that Ieſus Chriſte, is not in the bread and wine, but in the meane while where are their harts? Forſooth, ſome of their heartes are plunged ouer head and eares in couetouſneſſe, ſome of them are drunken with ambition, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome, their heartes are wrapped vp in all kind of villanie. For behold, the Whooremonger his mind, is ſet on nothing els, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Lecherie: others vpon drunkenneſſe, and belly cheare: in other ſome is nothing but blaſphemy, murmuring, &amp; all villanie, which Saint Paule calleth earthly members.<note place="margin">Coloſ. 3.<hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> If you will (ſaith he) come néere vnto Ieſus Chriſt, you muſt mortifie your earthly members What? muſt we forgoe our handes, and féete? No, that is not his meaning: But we muſt mortifie our fornications, vncleanneſſe, inordinate affections, euill concupiſcences, ambition, and coueto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſneſſe, which is worſhipping of Images, and all other ſuch like. Would wée then ſéeke for Ieſus Chriſt in heauen? Then muſt we rid our ſelues of al theſe earthly me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers. For what agréement can there be betwéene vs &amp; Ieſus Chriſt? Wée muſt not thruſt him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt our pollutions, but let vs goe vnto him, that hée may rid vs of them. Thus we ſée, that wee muſt not onely vnderſtande

How is that? Let vs liue chaſtly, ſoberly, charitably, temperat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, patiently, and altogether vertuoſly. And theſe are the fethers wherewith we muſt flie vp into heauen: although to ſpeake pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, wee muſt haue neither winges to flie with, nor yet ladders to climbe vp: But it is Ieſus Chriſte that bringeth vs thither, and rayſeth vs vp by the graces which I haue named, and which hée beſtoweth vpon vs. Héere then wée ſée, howe wee muſt apply this doctrine to the Supper: ſo that when the bread and wine ſhal be deliuered vs, wée muſt learne to ſéeke for all our felicitie in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte liue in brotherly loue together, and euery man morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his ſinfull luſtes and affections. If I féele my ſelfe to bée by any meanes carried away from Ieſus Chriſte, I ought to pull that meane from mée, out by the rootes: that I might bee truely rayſed vp to Ieſus Chriſt: not that we can be perfectly rayſed vp, but we muſt labour to goe more and more on. For in déede, the Supper was ordeined to that end, and we ſhould not receiue it onely once in our life, but very often: to ſignifie vnto vs, that we muſt goe on in this worlde, vntill ſuch time as he hath deliuered vs from this corrupt body, and brought vs vnto himſelfe.</p>
               <p>And according to this holy doctrine, let vs fall downe before the face of our good God, and acknowledge our offences, beſéeching him that he will not ſuffer vs to be ſo giuen ouer vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore we haue béen, but ſo weane vs from them, as that we ſéeke after none other thing, but our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and obey his commandementes, becauſe, that is the rule and order by which he would haue vs to bée brought vnto himſelfe.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE haue héeretofore ſpoken of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the Apoſtles, and of their patient wayting for the promiſe which Ieſus Chriſt had made them by mouth and beſides, although they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to this office of Apoſtleſhip, yet did they not thruſte them ſelues in to preach, before ſuch time as they had bin confirmed by the holy Ghoſt. Héere then wée ſee their obedience, ioyned with humilitie, in that they acknowledged God, to bee their guide. And now wée are to handle that which followeth, that when Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte told them of the promiſe of God his father, hée ſaid, <hi>yee haue hearde of mee,</hi> heretofore. As if hée ſhould haue ſaid, That they were not to looke for that at the handes of God, which they in their owne iudgement thought to bée beſt, but for the thing which he had promiſed. To bée ſhort, wee muſt héere gather a doctrine vnto our ſelues, which is this, wée muſt not build our faith vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that we our ſelues ſhall imagine,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17.</note> but vpon the promiſes of God. For Saint Paule ſaith, That faith commeth by hearing: not by the hering of mens ſpéeches and talkes, but only by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the worde of God. And in deed, becauſe wee are inclined to diuers temptations, it is méet we ſhould build vpon God, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his worde. Yea verily, howbeit he will not come downe from
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:7663:161"/> heauen to ſpeake to vs. That is true in déede: but we muſt be wel aſſured that the doctrine which is preached vnto vs, commeth from him: whereof Ieſus Chriſte is a witneſſe when he ſpake vnto his Apoſtles. For all things (ſaith hee) that I haue hearde of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, haue I made knowne vnto you.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 15.15.</note> And therefore you muſte not in any wiſe diſtruſt me, becauſe I am a faithfull witneſſe. For we ſée that Ieſus Chriſte neuer went beyond his bondes, What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer therfore that we waite for, let vs neither looke this way nor that, but ſtand to his worde.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, becauſe the name of God is often abuſed, let vs looke narrowly and warely whether it is hée that hath ſpoken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs or not. And although Ieſus Chriſte himſelfe ſpeaketh not at this preſent vnto vs, yet hath hee ratified whatſoeuer is contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Lawe and the Prophetes. Wee muſt not therefore ſtand in doubt of the doctrine. Why ſo? Becauſe it is allowed.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſée, that if wée follow this doctrine, we cannot do amiſſe: and contrariwiſe, this were a trimme kinde of ſpéeche, to ſay, wee are Chriſtians, when in very deede, there is nothing in vs but a vaine opinion.</p>
               <p>And nowe let vs beholde the faith which is taught in Popery. They will ſay forſooth, I beléeue this and that but if they be aſked why beléeue you ſo? They will anſwere, becauſe they were ſo told. But who is it that taught you thus? Our aunceſtours. Thus wée ſée, that there is no certentie in their beliefe, but a vaine opinion. And therefore we are to conſider of the great grace of GOD to vs warde, in that he hath pluckt vs from that religion: for wée go not nowe by thinking and gheſſing, but we muſt ſtay our ſelues vpon this infallible trueth which he hath giuen vs. In very déede wee cannot doe thus, without the holy Ghoſte ratifie the ſame in our heartes. For otherwiſe it were a iolly kinde of ſpéeche to ſay, God hath ſaide it, and this is his doctrine. And therefore vntill ſuche time as the holy Ghoſt hath wrought in vs to ſhew vs that the pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſes of God are Autenticall, wée ſhall but ſtumble. But as Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte is a faithfull witneſſe of God his Father, euen ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth hee vs by his holy ſpirite, and wee are to beſeech him that he would perfourme it more and more in vs. And this is it which wee at this preſent are to ſtande vpon. For Ieſus Chriſte promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſend the holy Ghoſte vnto his Apoſtles, as may bee ſeene in
<pb facs="tcp:7663:162"/> Iohns Goſpell,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14.16.26. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15.26.</note> where this promiſe is ſet downe that Ieſus Chriſt ſaid vnto them, when I am aſcended vp into heauen, I will ſende you the holy Ghoſte. This ſaying then hée confirmed vnto them, that they might conſtantly looke for it.</p>
               <p>It followeth, <hi>Iohn baptized with water, but yee ſhall be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with the holy Ghoſt.</hi> And this is a confirmation of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which he gaue them: as if hée ſhoulde haue ſaide, my office is to baptize, not with water: but with the holy Ghoſt. And God my Father h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th not giuen mée this office in vaine: and therefore you muſt féele the benefite thereof by experience. Let vs therefore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this one point, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> nothing is in vain giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Ieſus Chriſt. Now he hath no néede of this himſelfe: But it is for his members, to the end we might all draw grace with grace,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.16.</note> out of his fulneſſe. And ſo let vs conclude, that ſince Ieſus Chriſte hath this office of baptizing with the holy Ghoſte, wée muſt néedes féele it by proofe, and be partakers of ſuch a benefite: for otherwiſe it were but an vncertaine title, and no trueth in it: which were very blaſphemie ſo to ſay. Wee are therefore to vnderſtand, that Ieſus Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainteth vs with ſuch a Baptiſme. For, mark what it was that he ſaid to his Apoſtles. Now S. Iohn Baptiſt, had told the Iewes before, that he baptized but with water, and the reaſon why hee ſo ſaide, was this, that they would haue giuen ouermuch honor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and ſo haue derogated from Ieſus Chriſt. And therefore he refuſed this, and ſaid, that he did but adminiſter the viſible ſigne of water: ſo that it belonged not to him to giue grace to Baptiſme, but was the office of Ieſus Chriſt to doe it. Behold (ſaith he) I bap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tize you with water:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat. 3.</hi>11. <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Luke.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.26.</note> But there is one whom you yet know not, that hath power to baptize with the holy Ghoſte: whoſe ſhoe lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet I am not worthy to vntie: for although I came before him, yet am I, no body, and it is hée that muſt haue all the honor. And this is the ſpéech of Iohn Baptiſt: and now Ieſus Chriſt vſeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, as if he ſhould ſay, This ought to be no ſtrange thing vnto you: for it was knowne vnto you long ago, how that the priuiledge of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing with the holy Ghoſt, was reſerued to me alone. Nowe, héere might ariſe a queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, why Ieſus Chriſt rather ſpake of Iohn bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any other. The reaſon is manifeſt: becauſe the greatnes of Iohn Baptiſt, as they had abuſed it, was a let, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Ieſus Chriſte was not honored as he ought, &amp; although he had ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of any other,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7663:162"/> yet would it haue ben thought notwithſtanding y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Iohn might wel enough haue béen compared to Ieſus Chriſt. And therfore he choſe to ſpeak of the moſt excellent man, to the end he wold ſhew that he would not haue the worlde deceiued, but that it was himſelf vnto whom all honor was to be giuen. And thus we ſée, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> where men go about to get themſelues credite &amp; eſtimation amongſt men, Saint Iohn baptiſt here doth al he can to abaſe himſelf,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3.<hi>30.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe he would haue no more giuen vnto him, then became him. And after hee had vſed many ſpéeches, hée concluded, that he muſt be abaſed, and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt exalted, Neither was this hypocritically ſaide of him, but in trueth and in déede. And I would it pleaſed God that the world would take foorth this leſſon. But what? Wée are ſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually giuen to this wicked ſuperſtition, as that we looke ſtil vnto the creatures, who are ſo many vailes, to kéepe vs from beholding of Ieſus Chriſt, And by this wée ſée what the cauſe hath béen of the ſetting vp of ſuch an infinite number of Idols in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world. For, looke how many holy men and women haue béene in the world, euen ſo many Idols haue béen ſet vp: yea, although the graces which God hath liberally beſtowed vpon vs, ought to be Argumentes ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to haue vs put our truſt in him, &amp; not in creatures. And the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, when they will honor their Saints, ſay, it is written. Praiſe God in his Saints I will not call them beaſtes,<note place="margin">Pſal. 150.1.</note> for taking of this place after this ſorte, ſéeing the Prophet in ſaying, Praiſe God in his holy place, or in his Sanctuary, meaneth the heauens: as if hée ſhould haue ſaid, praiſe this diuine maieſtie, who ruleth in his hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uenly throne, ouer all his Creatures. And yet they ſo magnifie the Saints amongſt them, as that (as they themſelues ſay) God is not knowne from his Apoſtles, or els is placed all in one ranke with the reſt. Now this diueliſh Prouerbe which is among them, <hi>A man cannot know God from his Apoſtles:</hi> will bée a teſtimony againſt them, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue torne in peeces the glory of god, like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiffe Curres, &amp; haue beſtowed one péece of it in this place, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in that: and haue diuided it euen as pleaſed themſelues: and whereas Ieſus Chriſte ſhoulde haue béene onely exalted, and the Prophetes, and Martyrs made of no eſtimation in reſpect of him, they haue turned all cleane contrary. Wherefore ſéeing we are inclined to this ſinne, to magnifie Creatures, and to robbe Chriſt Ieſus of his glory, Let vs ſo muche the rather remember
<pb facs="tcp:7663:163"/> that which is ſaid, <hi>That Iohn baptized with water,</hi> to ſhew y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if we would haue any grace, we muſt neither goe to Peter, nor yet to Iohn,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3.34.</note> but to Ieſus Chriſt, of whom it is ſaide, that he receiued the grace of God full and whole: to ſhewe that we muſt come to him alone.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, héerein hath béen occaſion taken, to ſay, that the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of Iohn was imperfect: but this is plain deceite: for the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Iohn, when he ſpake ſo, was not to declare the truth of the Sacrament, which hee adminiſtred, but onely to ſhewe the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that was betwéene him, &amp; Ieſus Chriſte. And therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſacrament of Baptiſme which Iohn adminiſtred, and the Sacrament which Ieſus Chriſt adminiſtred, was al one, &amp; ten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded to one &amp; the ſelfeſame end, yet Iohn declared that it was not in his power to make baptiſme of any force, But that Ieſus Chriſte muſt do it. And therefore it is not to be doubted, but that he admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred true baptiſme: For we looke not to the ſigne, but to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth: and yet the ſigne agréeeth with the trueth of Ieſus Chriſt. But the principall matter which we haue to conſider of in Baptiſme, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth vpon two points: that is, that we haue put of the old Adam, and are renued, &amp; vnited to Ieſus Chriſt: &amp; cleanſed of al our ſpots, when God forgiueth vs our ſinnes. And this is the ſumme &amp; effect of Baptiſme,</p>

                  </note>Let vs now conſider if Iohn did not al this. It is moſt certaine that he did: For he came &amp; preached remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſins: &amp; baptized to that end &amp; purpoſe. Moreouer, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he baptized, he preached repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which importeth as much as we haue ſaid, That wee our ſelues muſt be mortified, &amp; this corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which wee receiued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Adam, muſt be put of, that the righteouſnes of god might reigne in vs. And ſo, when as we haue thruſt out all the corruption we can, yet ſhal we find nothing els in vs But what? we muſt make a diffe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rence betwéene the perſon of the Miniſter, and the perſon of Ieſus Chriſt. In déed this is true, that when we ſpeake of baptiſme as it is in it ſelf,<note place="margin">Acts. 9.18</note> it is a waſhing away of our ſinnes. How ſo? Becauſe, by it we are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed &amp; ingraffed into Ieſus Chriſt, that we might be cleanſed, &amp; liue by his mighty power. For ſo ſaith the ſcripture, as may be ſéen whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Annanias baptized Paul, who ſaid to him, <hi>come,</hi> and waſh away thy ſins. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> baptiſme is ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of, we ſpeake not only of the ſigne, but of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> thing ſignified: to wit, that we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:7663:163"/> to God through the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, and renued by his holy ſpirit, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende we might no longer liue to our ſelues and as we luſt. Wherfore doo wée ſaye that all this is within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of Baptiſme, forſooth, becauſe the commiſſion of Ieſus Chriſt is moſt certaine and ſure: and hee performeth that inwardlye whiche is outwardlye ſignified: for otherwiſe it were but a may game, if the truth were not ioyned together with the ſigne.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſée how God ioyneth the truth with the ſigne to the end wée might vnderſtand, and know that as the viſible ſigne ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a thing, euen ſo alſo receiue we the graces therein ſignified. And the like may bée ſaide of the Supper. For when wee come to the ſupper, looke how the miniſter diſtributeth to vs the bread and wine, euen ſo doth Ieſus Chriſt make vs partakers of his body &amp; blood, that we might bee truly, and indéede, his members: and by that meane, we may ſay that the ſupper is a partaking of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood of our Lorde Ieſus. But when wee ſhall come to handle by péece meale the thing which mortall man doth, we muſt then looke what power and authoritie he hath. As when I bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, to wit, whether haue I the holy ghoſt in my ſléeue to giue or not? or when I celebrate the holy ſupper, haue I the body &amp; blood of our Lord Ieſus, to giue to whom it liketh mée? Now this were ouer great arrogancy, to attribute that, to mortall men which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belongeth to Ieſus chriſt. And therfore let vs not take from Ieſus Chriſt, the office of baptiſing with the holy ghoſt. For, as I take water to baptize, euen ſo doth Ieſus Chriſt accompliſhe the thinge which I ſignifie, by his owne power and might. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs mark the ſaying of Saint Iohn, I baptiſe with water (ſaith hée) and Ieſus Chriſt baptiſeth with the holy ghoſt. Thus we ſée what we haue héere already handled, and ſhal be more thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ughly in the eleuenth chapter.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is for vs thus to make aunſwer: to witte,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts.</hi> 11.16.</note> that wée cannot fulfyl the things, wherof we make a ſhew. And yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, we muſt aſſure our ſelues this, that God accompliſheth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, which is ſignified by the ſigne: and as by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water, is ſignified the waſhing away of ſinnes, euen ſo doth he accompliſh it by his blood. And thus we ſée how we muſt diſtinguiſh betwéene the perſon of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and the perſon of the Miniſter, to the ende
<pb facs="tcp:7663:164"/> euery man might haue his degrée and meaſure, and wée to know, that Ieſus Chriſt is the fountaine of all perfection.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, this is certaine, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iohn ſaid that Ieſus Chriſt ſhould baptize with the holie Ghoſt and with fire, this doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.11.</note> but that the holy Ghoſt did once appeare in the ſame ſhape: For this promiſe hath byn already performed, and ſhal take place vnto the worldes end. Let vs then conſider, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when the holy Ghoſt was viſibly ſent vnto the Apoſtles, it was to ſignifie vnto vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Church ſhould bée alwayes gouerned by the holie Ghoſt, &amp; ſhould fill vs with ſo many of his graces as were néedfull. In very déede, we ſhal neuer haue them in ful perfection, becauſe it is néedful that we ſhould be humbled. For if wée ſhoulde haue them in ful perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, what would become of vs? Surely, we would neuer haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie care to call vpon God, neither yet once thinke that wée ſtoode in néede of him. And therefore it is méete wée ſhoulde alwayes féele the want of his benefites, to the end wée might bée ſtirred vp to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſéech him liberally to beſtow them on vs. But by the way, let vs vnderſtand that wée are all baptized with the holy Ghoſt and with fire: and that Ieſus Chriſt will in no wiſe that his Sacramentes ſhould bée receiued in vayne of his faithful ones. In déed, although a man bée baptized in the name of God, yet when hée commeth to age, wée ſée him enclined to all miſchiefe, and therefore wée cannot ſay that hée is a new man, but rather like a bruite beaſt. And yet wée cannot ſay, but that the Sacrament had his full nature and proprietie: For baptiſme of it ſelfe is as much as if we were renu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and then if wée bée not ſo, the fault is oures: becauſe wee will not ſuffer Ieſus Chriſt to accompliſhe his grace in vs, and ſo for want of beliefe, wée in ſuch ſort cloſe vp our heartes, as that there is no entraunce for his graces, which hée woulde largely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow vpon vs.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſée that the Sacrament is neuer without his power and vertue, howbeit we receiue no fruit nor benefite by it, becauſe it cannot enter without faith. Wée haue héere therefore to note, that the trueth of Baptiſme is not in the water, but in the holie Ghoſt. And beſides Ieſus Chriſt geueth vs the holie Ghoſt. And therefore wée are throughly to marke, that if we woulde bée bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by Baptiſme, we muſt not ſticke ſo much to the water, as though our ſaluation were encloſed therein: but let vs vnderſtand
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:7663:164"/> that it is the holie Ghoſt that muſt woorke all.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, wée ſée that the worlde hath receiued this doctrine very perniciouſly: for the Papiſtes thinke, that the grace of God is tyed to it, and they charme it like Coniurers, geuing to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the power of the Sacrament. And therefore they ſay, that that childe that is not baptized, is damned. Wherefore, for the preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this danger, they are not onely contented to geue power &amp; authoritie to all men, of what ſtate and condition ſoeuer they bée, to baptize, but euen to women alſo: for feare, ſay they, that the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren might die without baptiſme. And ſo, they think that the truth of baptiſme conſiſteth in the water: ſo that by this meane the blood of Ieſus Chriſt is layde cleane aſide. But as for vs, let vs learne, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth of baptiſme is not in the water, but in the holy Ghoſt. And yet is not the ſigne vnprofitable: for it witneſſeth vnto vs that our ſoules are waſhed: But if wée wil haue the truth of it, we muſt come to the holie Ghoſt as wée haue already ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is ſaide, that Ieſus Chriſt giueth the holy Ghoſt to the end wée ſhould neither ſéeke for it in the water, nor yet at the handes of men, but looke vp vnto heauen. And this is alſo a poynt wherewith the world hath béen deceiued. For who is hée that loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to Ieſus Chriſt, when we ſpeake of any thing concerning our ſaluation? No man: For wée thinke it to bée in the power of men, as if Ieſus Chriſt had reſigned his office vnto them, &amp; that he had no more to doe in heauen: Sée I pray you, how blockiſhe wee are. Nowe the Scripture choketh vs by the chin (as wée ſay) to make vs looke aloft: for in it, is the thing which wée heare Ieſus Chriſt teache vs, beholde, it is I that baptizeth you. I graunt, it is ſaid that God ſendeth the holie Ghoſt: and ſo doeth Ieſus Chriſt alſo:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 14.16.26. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 15.26. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18.</note> For when the father ſendeth him, hée ſendeth him in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; at his requeſt: And beſides, Ieſus Chriſt ſpeaking of himſelf ſaid, that hée would ſend him. And indéede, hée is one and the ſelfeſame God with the father. And beſides, inaſmuch as being made man, hée became our Mediator, al power both in heauen and earth was giuen him, ſo that hée is as it were the very arme and hande, to beſtow y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> graces of God vpon vs. Let vs alſo note, why it was that Iohn ſpake of the Baptiſme with the holie Ghoſt and with fire, vſing theſe twoo woordes: For it is all one thing.</p>
               <p>When hée ſpeaketh of fire, it is becauſe hée meaneth to boyle vs
<pb facs="tcp:7663:165"/> againe, to ſcombe of al our filthyneſſe: as men vſe to melt golde or ſiluer, when they would fine it, and as we ſée men purge filthy pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with fyre. And therfore the holy ghoſt beareth not this name in vaine: ſéeing it is hée that muſt purge all our ſpots and blots: and it is alſo to ſignifie vnto vs, that ſo ſoone as we come into this worlde, we bring nothing with vs but vncleaneſſe, and the longer wée liue, the greater heape of vncleane thinges wée lay vp toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: whereof <hi>Ieremie</hi> ſpeaketh ſayinge, that man knoweth not himſelfe:<note place="margin">Ierem. <hi>17.</hi>9.</note> for there is ſuch a gulfe of wickedneſſe in vs, as there is none but God alone that knoweth it.</p>
               <p>A man may well caſt an Anchor into the bottom of the ſea, but none is able to ſearch our harts but God. For we ſtinke before the face of God, and are more filthy then <hi>Lazarus,</hi> yea too too horrible ſtinking and filthy. But what of all this? Beholde héere is our comfort, whenas wée ſée that Ieſus Chriſt wil purge vs by his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit: for we haue thereof a ſure teſtimonye in Baptiſme, that he wil make vs new cretures, by purging of our infirmities. But as by purging with fyre, all ſuperfluities are taken away, euen ſo alſo let vs vnderſtande that when God will reconcile vs to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, all what ſoeuer is ours muſt bee cleane taken away.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, let vs note, that ſo longe as wee ſhall remayne in our ſelues, wee cannot chooſe, but periſh, and yet if wée would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies remaine ſafe and ſounde, GOD muſt néedes bray vs that hée might ſaue vs, and make vs become acceptable in his ſighte. And this hée doth by his holy ſpirit. And thus wée ſée y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is by God alone that we muſt be gloryfied.</p>
               <p>Indéede, we are contented to haue a good opinion of our ſelues, that we might be extolled amongſt men: but when it ſhall be ſifted before the maieſtie of God, the thing that wée thought to be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, hée will make no reckoninge of. Let vs learne then, that there is no goodneſſe at all in vs: but if there be any, it is becauſe that he hath purged vs with his holy ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, when he ſaieth, <hi>That it ſhall be after a while,</hi> it is to encourage them the more: and not to murmer, and be diſcouraged when God deferreth his aide: for wee muſt appoint him no time. And indéede, the time which he taketh is alwaies very ſhort, How ſo? becauſe hée leaueth vs not one minute of an houre without

By this we ſee a proofe of his ayde, when as we quaile not. For as S.

                  </note> Thus we ſée that although God deliuereth vs not foorthwith, yet leaueth he not vs euer languiſhing: For ſo long as we are able to ſay, that we haue life, God promiſeth to aſſiſt vs againſt all aſſalts, and to deliuer vs: howbeit we muſt warre againſt all the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of our fleſh, ſo long as we are in this world.

Let vs now ſée, wherefore hée ſaid that it ſhould be within a ſhort time after. And ſo let vs learne to make our profit vpon this place: which is, not onely to vnderſtand that Ieſus Chriſt ſpake it to his Apoſtles, but that it was alſo ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to vs. True it is, that we receiue not the holy Ghoſt in a firie maner: and yet this office was not giuen to Ieſus Chriſt in vaine, and we haue alſo the power thereof: neither hath hée taken Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme a way with him: But euen as hée hath left vs the ſigne, ſo likewiſe is it eftſoones a manifeſt proofe, that he will alwayes bée preſent with vs, to make this Sacrament availeable vnto vs by his holie ſpirite. And we muſt alſo acknowledge, that we are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether polluted, to the ende we might goe to Ieſus Chriſt, and bée made cleane by him. In déed, this counſell would neuer come from our ſelues, and therefore muſt God, by the admonitions which he hath ſet downe for that purpoſe, bring vs to Ieſus Chriſt for the finding out of the trueth of Baptiſme.

Nowe, vnder this woorde weakneſſe, I meane all our vices and imperfections: as very féeble thinges, and eaſily to bée ouercome with euery temptation, according to the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and peruerſeneſſe of our groſe wits and mindes. Wherefore, whenas wée ſhal haue déepely conſidered of theſe thinges, wée muſt pray vnto God, and beſéech him to haue an eye to the remedying of all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, wherunto wée are ſubiect. Thus we ſée I ſay, how wée ſhal greatly profite our ſelues, by the conſideration of theſe things. We haue therfore to note the matter which Saint Luke ſetteth downe héere in this place: becauſe hée declareth how groſſe mynded the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles were, hauing béen taught by the ſpace of thrée whole yéeres, from the mouth of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt all whatſoeuer belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to their ſaluation. Héere then wée ſée that they are like vnto young Schollers, as if they had neuer vnderſtood one woord of that which was taught them. And what is the reaſon? Forſooth, wée ſhould bée continually vnable to any goodneſſe without GOD ſhoulde firſte correct this ignoraunce: which is a thing that ought greatly to humble vs. And therefore, wée muſt vnderſtand that our hearing of whatſoeuer is ſaide vnto vs, will bée to no purpoſe, and that becauſe it is ſpoken as vnto a Blocke, vntil ſuch time as God taketh away the groſneſſe of our corrupt nature: for els wée ſhall neuer vnderſtand what hée ſaith vnto vs: by reaſon his woord is farre beyong our reach. Neither néed wée any other proofe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne the ignorance of the Apoſtles, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their own words. For the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which they aſked Ieſus Chriſt was fooliſh, &amp; of no valure: but only a ſuperfluous curioſity, whenas they ſaide vnto him, wilt thou at this time reſtore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Iſrael? now by ſaying, <hi>at this time</hi> they declared y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they would eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the firſt daſh, haue come to honor without any more paynes taking, &amp; whereas they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to take paines for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel throughout y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, they wold in no wiſe away w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, but be forth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> filled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> al maner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was a double fault: beſides, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſpake of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>

                  </gap>ayled alſo in that: For they thought our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſhould haue béen an earthly King, and reigne after the manner of worldly Princes: and ſo they being neare about him, ſhould take no paine nor haue any harme, but liue honourably with great offices, and in high dignitie. And they fayled alſo in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> becauſe they reſtrained the grace of God to Iſrael, which hée had promiſed to all the world. Thus we ſée that they ſpake neuer a word which was not falſe and erronious. Moreouer, Ieſus Chriſt reproued them with the anſwere which hée made them: and although hée ſaide not flatly, you are deceiued: yet, the wordes which hée vſed, declare no leſſe, but that hée ſpake them to their reproofe, when as hée ſaide, <hi>It is not for you to know the times and the ſeaſons, which the Father hath put in his owne power:</hi> hée reproued them of this fonde curioſitie, for where they ſhoulde haue enquired after ſome neceſſarie, or profitable matter, their mindes roued at curious thinges, and of no valure. Howbéeit we muſt content our ſelues with that which it pleaſeth God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto vs, and we cannot doe better then to be ignorant of that which God will not teach vs in the ſcripture, and thus we ſée how hee reproueth this their curioſitie.</p>
               <p>Beſides, when hee ſaide vnto them, <hi>Yee ſhall receiue power af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the holy Ghoſt is come vpon you:</hi> Héereby hée ſhewed them, that they were fooles to aſpire ſo high, as to enquire and ſeeke after the ſecretes of God: For they were not able to attaine thereto, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they had receiued this power from aboue. In déede, they had receiued ſome portion of the holie Ghoſt: but hee tolde them that it was verie néedfull the ſame ſhould be encreaſed in them: and that it was then, no time to tryumph, but to fight: and they might ſée alſo, that it was not long before it ſhould come to paſſe. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde hée ſaide, <hi>Yee ſhall be witneſſes vnto mee, both in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, in all Iewrie, and in Samaria, and euen vnto the worldes ende:</hi> As if hée ſhoulde haue ſaide, you thinke that I ſhoulde reigne lyke a worldly Prince, but you are deceiued, for my king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is ſpirituall.</p>
               <p>And thus hée correcteth their laſt errour, touching their queſtion of the kingdome of Iſrael, by ſaying, that the Goſpell muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neied euen to Samaria: For there was great inimitie betwéene the Iewes and the Samaritanes, albeit they were néere neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7663:167"/> and agréeed ſo me what in the principles of religion, as wée and the Papiſts doe at this day: For there is a kinde of familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie betwéene vs, becauſe we haue the Goſpell, and they alſo ſay, that they haue it. The Samaritanes likewiſe had the ſame law, with the Iewes, but they had altogether peruerted it, euen as the Papiſts now do: and therefore the hatred was the greater be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them.</p>
               <p>Now, Ieſus Chriſte telleth his Apoſtles héere, That the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel muſt bée preached to the Samaritanes. Wée ſee then that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte liuely reproueth their errors, and bringeth them into the right way. This muſt wée apply to our owne vſe: and in the firſt place, if the Apoſtles were ſo groſſe minded, as wée may ſée very well, this vice was not in them alone, but it is alſo in vs. And therefore let vs looke vpon this as in a glaſſe, that it is not enough that we bée preached vnto, but God muſt alſo inlighten vs, &amp; make a way for his worde that it might enter into vs, and open alſo the eyes of our mindes, that wée may bée able to comprehend his wil: for els our hearing will bée to no purpoſe, and without profite.</p>
               <p>And therefore let vs beſéeche God to graunt vs his grace to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his will: or els wée ſhall remaine in our beaſt lineſſe ſtil. Héere wée ſée what wée are to note in the firſt place of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>Now, for the faultes which the Apoſtles co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted in their que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, we muſt conſider of them, by the reprochfull anſwere which Ieſus Chriſt maketh them. In the firſt place we ſée, that wée our ſelues haue experience euen of our ſelues, how curious we are. And now let vs ſée whether we are giuen to deſire ſuch thinges as are neceſſary &amp; méete for vs. Surely no, for, if we be told twiſe of a thing, we thinke it doth but breake our braine. Againe, if an harde matter, yea &amp; ſuch a thing as in déed is moſt neceſſary to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, be told vs in two words, we thinke it euen enough. What an inconſtancie is this in vs, not to ſettle our mindes vpon neceſſary things? But if we ſhould heare a ſort of tales, lyes, and things no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth, ho, wee would neuer bée weary of hearing of them all the day and night long. And thus we ſée y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our minds are ſo toyiſh, as that we haue no care of any neceſſary things: but are deſirous of all vaine and vnprofitable matter: yea, and to ſpeake of any
<pb facs="tcp:7663:168"/> good and profitable thing, it is (as wée ſay) loſt labour. Héere wée may perceiue, how wée ought to beſtow al our life time, to wit, to conſider of the grace that God hath giuen vs, in ſending of vs Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to make vs wiſe: for this wiſedome ſtretcheth it ſelfe through heauen and earth. And this is it whereof S. Paule ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to the Epheſians,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephe.</hi> 3.18.</note> when he maketh mention of length, bredth, heigth, and depth: That is to ſay, that ſo farrefooth as our mindes are able to reache, we ſhould giue our ſelues more and more to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande the loue which Ieſus Chriſt hath ſhewed vs, in beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of vs his welbeloued Sonne Ieſus Chriſt. After this ſort (as I haue ſaide) muſt wée beſtow our time: and yet if we be but prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto, one halfe houre, wée thinke it ouer long. Whereby we ſée howe wandring minded wée are to all vayne and vnprofitable thinges: and therein take all our delight and pleaſure. But if there bée any matter in queſtion that might confirme and ſtay vs, or that wée bée tolde of thinges that ſhall come vnto vs, wée will neuer hearken to that, but our minde will foorthwith be turned cleane away, wandring too and fro, building (as wée ſay) caſtles in the ayre: ſo that hée which hath Goods, thinketh neither of his poſſeſſions, nor of his riches, and hée that hath none, will continue and abide like a ſenſleſſe bruite beaſt, and neuer once thinke vpon that which is ſpoken vnto him. Behold I pray you how cloſely we are linked to this vice, and there is no man, but is condemned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God thereof. And although wée ſée that the Apoſtles were curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to vnderſtande of thinges which appertayned nothing vnto them, yet let not vs be buſie to conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne them in it, but let vs know that there is matter ynough in vs to condemne our ſelues. Séeing then wée know this to bée ſo common a fault, euery of vs ought to withdraw his mind from being ſo fantaſticall, and not wittingly, be ſo toy headed, but let vs apply our minds, to vnderſtand what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it pleaſeth God liberally to beſtow vpon vs from out of the knowledge of his counſell, and hold vs there: and let vs diligently weigh the ſaying that is héere ſet downe. <hi>It is not for you to know the times and ſeaſons, which the father, hath put in his owne pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> Now this ſaying ought to bridle vs and pull vs backe at once, from al curioſitie, yea and although our nature would pricke vs to goe on, yet ought wée to draw backe, and vnderſtand what Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7663:168"/> ſaieth, that hée which goeth about to ſeeke out the ſecretes of God, ſhall bée oppreſſed with his glory.<note place="margin">Prou. 25, 27.</note> And therefore if wée be ſuch curious ſearchers, hée will make vs right well feele, that hée ſpake not this in vayne. Wherefore let not vs goe beyond this reach: but let vs looke what it is that hée forbiddeth vs to ſearche after: <hi>That which the Father hath put in his owne power.</hi> Now héere might riſe a queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to wit, whether the father hath put in his owne pow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er, Winter, and Summer, and the rule of all times, and ſeaſons? Yea, it is true. It ſhould ſéeme then, that his meaning is, that wée ought not to make enquiry after theſe thinges. No not ſo, for that is not the thing which the father hath in his owne power, whereof Ieſus Chriſt ſpake vnto his Apoſtles, that it is not for them to know of it: but hée ſpake of thinges which hée reſerued a part vnto himſelfe, and the knowledge of which, is cléerely forbidden vs: and therefore not for vs to know of it. Now hée hath declared vnto vs, the thinges which come by order of nature: that winter muſt bée cold, and Summer whot. For if wée haue any great colde in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, let vs vnderſtand that ſuch a peruerting of the order of nature commeth by reaſon of our ſinnes, and that for the horribleneſſe of them wée iuſtly deſerue, that all thinges ſhoulde bée turned out of courſe: Howbeit God ceaſeth not to helpe all thoſe things. So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſince God hath declared this vnto vs, hée hath not reſerued it, to himſelfe alone. For hée would not haue vs to imagine his power to bée a ſuperfluous power: but the thing which hée would not haue vs know, hée ſo kéepeth backe, as that wée ſhall neuer bée able to vnderſtand it.</p>
               <p>This ſaying then of Ieſus Chriſt, it is not for you to knowe the times &amp; ſeaſons which the Father hath put in his owne power is as much as if hée had ſayde, Bée contented with that which I haue ſayde vnto you, and hold you there: For if you would enter into diſputation with him to enquire after that which he would not haue you knowe, It woulde turne to your confuſion: ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng hée hath not ſpared to let you vnderſtande, whatſoeuer hee thought to bée méete for you to knowe. Nowe, if wée woulde goe beyonde this, this were, as a man would ſay to ſet our ſelues againſt him.</p>
               <p>Let vs ſée then what we are to note out of this place, to witte,

And ouer and beſides all this, let vs not bée too too inquiſitiue and ſay, Why is this: and wherefore is that: But let vs take héede of ſuch curiouſneſſe, as of a deadly Plague. Now, this can no man doe, without euery of vs violently ſtriueth againſt his owne nature: for we are naturally inclined to ſuch foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe, as to leaue the principall matter which is moſt neceſſary for vs, and to occupie our heads about that which is neither neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary nor profitable, but onely fooliſh and vaine curiouſneſſe: as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of vs for our own part ſheweth himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As for example: behold, wée haue the Goſpell, the very fountaine of all wiſedome, which teacheth vs to beléeue in God, to runne onely to him, and cal vpon him, to the end we might fight againſt all our carnall affections, to ſubmit our ſelues wholy obedient vnto him. Loe, this is the very meaning of our Lord, throughout all the Scripture.</p>
               <p>Now, wée thinke this to bée but a ſmall matter to vnderſtand, &amp; euery of vs ſéeketh to ſticke vnto ſuch thinges as God woulde not haue vs knowe: wée woulde faine contruoll our Lorde: and wee thinke hee had doone better, if hée had doone otherwiſe, Marke, how it fareth with vs. And therefore as I haue ſaid, If we would put this doctrine in practiſe, and not bée curious, wée muſt euery of vs brydle his nature, becauſe it driueth vs into ſuch imaginations whereby, man is not contented to conſider of God in the creation of the world, although theſe workes therein are enough where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to ſatiſfie vs. But what? Wée forget euen thoſe his workes which he wrought for our redemption (a worke without length, depth, breadth, and heigth) and goe about to enquire why God ſo greatly buſied himſelfe in the creation of the worlde,<note place="margin">

               <p>We ſée therefore that we muſt content our ſelues with the things which God hath giuen vs to vnderſtand: for although we haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held them all our lyfe long, yet haue we not haue had time inough to vnderſtand y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt part of them. And let euery man know, that he muſt obey whatſoeuer Ieſus Chriſt hath ſaide, and not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after that which the Father hath reſerued to himſelf, to wit, the thinges which are not declared by his word.</p>
               <p>Héereby, we ſée that he ſheweth vs our vncapableneſſe, which hée more and more confirmeth in this that followeth, ſaying, <hi>But you ſhall receiue power, after the holy ghoſt is come vpon you:</hi> and then ſhall you be better able to vnderſtand the thing whiche God hath declared vnto you.</p>
               <p>In this, Ieſus Chriſt aduiſeth vs, that wee doo raſhly in enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to vnderſtand farther of any thing, then God declareth vnto vs For it is as if wée who haue no winges, would flye beyond the Moone: ſéeing that if wée knew our ſtate, wée would be very wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie how wée aduaunced our ſelues as wée are wonted to doo. And héerein we are diligently to note this ſaying, <hi>The power of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ghoſt comming vpon you:</hi> Which is as much as if he had ſaid, <hi>vnderſtand yee poore and miſerable wretches,</hi> What you are, what ſpirite haue you to vnderſtand ſo hie thinges? how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for theſe thinges to enter into you. Learne therefore to humble your ſelues rather, and acknowledge your ignorance, and pray vnto God.</p>
               <p>In ſumme, wée haue héere a generall aduertiſment, that whiles God leaueth vs to our owne wittes, we are as bruitiſhe as maye be, and the leaſt thing in the world will dull vs: ſo that wee ſhall not be able to vnderſtand the leaſt percell of ſcripture, although it be handeled before vs péecemeale. And therfore this vnderſtanding muſt come from God, who of his méere goodneſſe beſtoweth it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs. For although we haue the Scriptures expounded vnto vs, it is none otherwiſe then as if the Sun ſhined vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, being ſtark blinde.

               <p>Let vs now come to the ſeconde errour, which is, they woulde haue bene honorable at the firſt, and beſides they would haue ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued according to their harts deſire without any paines takinge. Now, this is a falt which is common vnto vs all: for there is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb facs="tcp:7663:170"/> a man in the worlde but deſireth to reigne with Ieſus Chriſte in that euerlaſting kingdome which he hath promiſed: But when we are tolde of the bearing of his Croſſe, and of fightinge againſt Satan, the world, and our owne fleſh, when we are tolde of this, I ſay, wée would gladly draw our ſelues out of the heape. Wherfore wée are ſo much the rather to conſider of this place, to witte, that if we would be partakers of the benefits of Ieſus Chriſt, wee muſt euen in this lyfe ſet our hand to the labor.</p>
               <p>Would wée bée conquerours with him? let vs the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fight whiles wée are in the warres. And if we would be partakers of al his benefits we muſt abide all the miſeries which he will haue vs beare in this world.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.<hi>17.</hi> 2. Tim. <hi>2.12.</hi>
                  </note> For as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, if we bee partakers of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feringes, we ſhall alſo be partakers of his ioyes.</p>
               <p>Behold, Ieſus Chriſt now ſitteth in his glorious throne, into whoſe hande all things are put: But how behaued hée himſelfe in this world before he came to it? what numbers of afflictions ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered he? ſurely he was ſo afflicted, as that his life was thought to be accurſed: for, he was continually tormented all his life longe: and in the ende, wée ſée that he ſuffered the moſt cruell death, that was poſſibly to be deuiſed, and that which is more, it ſéemed that God his father had forſaken him, in that he ſuffered him to be thus condemned by the world. Héere then we are to conſider, that if we entend to enter into this immortall glory, wee muſt beare his croſſe in this preſent lyfe.</p>
               <p>Now, we coulde be very well contented to beare a litle blame for him. But we would not ſtep one foote forewarde to abide to be hated, deſpiſed, and afflicted. And yet this muſt wee doo becauſe it is not in vs to chaunge the inviolable order, which God hath ſette downe. We would bee glad to know what is done in heauen, but we would not hold the way thither, and ſurely God hath not pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vs héere belowe, but to the ende to ſerue Ieſus Chriſt in this worlde, that we might be partakers of his glory, after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wee haue with might and maine reſiſted all the aſſaultes whiche were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted againſt vs, for the withdrawing of vs from him. But if we haue a deſire to know what is done in heauen, and will not holde the way thither, it is very mockery. Wee muſt therefore, looke whereunto God hath called vs, and wee ſhall finde that hee hath called vs to fight, and it is ſo harde a matter for vs to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:7663:170"/> theſe combates as that wee ſhall haue no leyſure to occupie our ſelues to ſéeke after vaine and curious thinges which ſerue vs to no purpoſe: but let it ſuffice vs that we haue this worde which ſheweth vs which way to holde. Now, héere are two things wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Ieſus Chriſt correcteth the curioſitie of his Apoſtles: to wit, he telleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they muſt diſcerne of the thing which they haue to doe. Loe here I ſay, is the way whereby to correct this faulte whereunto we are enclined: to wit, we muſt looke vnto the thing which God teacheth vs by his worde: and then if we ſhall be very diligent héerein, we ſhal ſurely be quit of this fault, of béeing ouer foole hardie and curious. Firſt of all, they haue the promiſes which Ieſus Chriſt made them: <hi>The holie Ghoſt ſhall come vpon you:</hi> As if he ſhoulde haue ſaide, Bee you contented with that which God meaneth to ſend you. And therefore let vs learne, that when our nature tickleth vs, to caſt away our fond preſumption, and hold vs to the promiſes of GOD, and acknowledge and ſay, Loe wherunto it is that we muſt ſticke, let vs then be contented here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, &amp; féed and refreſh vs with it. And beſides, wée haue the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements of God to leade vs to vnderſtand what he wil haue vs to doe.</p>
               <p>When then wee knowe all this, wée ſhall haue no leyſure to roame ouer the fieldes: But wée ſhall finde roome ynough in the high way: yea euen to flye when there were any thing ſpoken of which hée commaunded vs. Which thing wée ſhoulde more eaſily vnderſtand, if we knewe that the woorde of God were the phiſicke that coulde amend this curioſitie. Howe is that? Beholde that GOD promiſeth to aſſiſt vs in this preſent life: and Ieſus Chriſt likewiſe hath taught vs to deſire our daily bread. But what of all this? yet is not this the principall poynt: for hée extendeth his hand euen to the bruite beaſtes and féedeth them.</p>
               <p>And therefore it were nothing for vs to looke into: But our principall matter is, to taſte his mercie, knowing that hée hath compaſſion vpon moſt miſerable wretched ſinners, and woulde not haue vs periſhe in our follies, but ſtretcheth foorth his hande to pull vs out of them, and therefore let vs truſt vnto it. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, hee calleth vs vnto euerlaſting life with Ieſus Chriſt &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth vs that we ſhalbée vnited to him.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7663:171" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Séeing then we haue all theſe promiſes, let euery of vs acquainte himſelfe with the ſame both morning and eueninge, and let it bee our wiſdome. And beſides, wée haue his commaundementes whereunto wée muſt cleaue, &amp; not bée bée ſmeared with ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and let euerye man forſake him ſelfe, and liue to together in loue and charitie one with another, ſoberly, chaſtly, humblye, and honeſtly: and be pure &amp; cleane from all the filthineſſe of the fleſh: loe héere a generall rule.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, in them euery man is taught his perticular leſſon. For firſte the Huſbande is taught to vnderſtande what loue hee ought to beare vnto his wife, and the wife her dutie towardes her Huſband: and either of them are aduertiſed what inſtruction they ought to giue vnto their Children.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the Maieſtrates are taught their leſſons, and the Miniſter of the worde theirs. To be ſhort, this is a perfect doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine accompliſhed in all poynts, where euery man is ſo ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye inſtructed, that no man can be ignoraunt of his charge and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And thus we ſée what we haue to note: And therefore, if euery man apply himſelf héereunto as he ought, without doubt hee ſhall haue no leaſure to royle ouer the féeldes.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, if wée be ſuch royling roges, ſurely it is a ſigne that we neuer vnderſtood the principall point of our ſaluation, nor yet how to bée the Diſciples of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. And thus we may be able to reproue theſe curious queſtioners, and ſaye vnto them, freind, becauſe you are ſo full of fryuelous queſtions, ſurelye you neuer yet vnderſtood the effect of your Baptiſme: for by it you ſhould acknowledge the forſaking of your ſelfe, but you could now be wel pleaſed that God would giue you leaue to wander whether you luſt your ſelfe: well, goe your waies and ſtudy of theſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and an hundred yeares hence they ſhall be diſputed of.</p>
               <p>Wherefore wée ought to bée ſo much the rather dilligent, thus to think, marke whereunto God calleth vs: to witte, that we might vnderſtande, wherein the hope of our ſaluation conſiſteth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, let vs beſéeche him that hée would haue mercy vpon vs, and that we might alſo learne to amend our liues.</p>
               <p>And héereunto muſt wee bende all our wit and force: and when wée ſhall ſtande in doubte to bée drawne this way and that, wee
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7663:171"/> muſt altogether endeuour our ſelues to haue a regard to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and then is Ieſus Chriſte our Phiſition, who is able to remedy vs.</p>
               <p>And according to this doctrine, let vs fal down before the Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of our good God, and acknowledge our offences, beſéeching him not to remember our life paſſed, but to giue vs warning thereof, to the end that wée being aſhamed of our ſelues, it would pleaſe him ſo to gouerne vs, as that after this life wée might reigne alſo with him, And ſo let vs ſay, O Almightie God, and heauenly father, &amp;c.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow we haue at this time to ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dle the matter which S. Luke héere ſetteth down, of the Apoſtles beholding of the Aſcention of our Lord Ieſus into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Now, it is not enough for vs that we knowe the hyſtorie, but wée are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to note that hée ſetteth downe this as a chiefe Article of our Faith: and ſurely the Articles of our faith are not onely profitable, but alſo neceſſary for
<pb facs="tcp:7663:172"/> our ſaluation. Howbeit wée ſhall neuer profite our ſelues greatly by the Aſcention of our Lorde, without we know it to be true in déede. And therefore Saint Luke ſaith, that the Apoſtles ſawe him aſcend: and ſaith beſides, that they abode ſtil gazing there vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch time as they were told that they muſt tarry no longer, but returne to Ieruſalem to doe their office as was commanded them, vntill the iudgement day. Thus we ſée what he ſaith of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention of our Lorde, to the end it might not be called againe into queſtion. Very true it is, that is ſaide, that they are bleſſed which haue beléeued, and not ſéene. Wherefore, wée muſt beléeue this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention rather then if wée had ſéene it: for ſince the Apoſtles ſee it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.29.</note> and tell vs of it, it is not for vs any whit to doubt thereof. Let vs nowe come, to the wordes of S. Luke, <hi>That a clowd receiued him vp out of their ſight.</hi> Now, here might a queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be aſked, why the heauens opened not, that the Apoſtles might haue ſéen the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious eſtate of our Lord Ieſus. But there was great reaſon, why they ſhould looſe the ſight of him, by meane of a cloude: becauſe our Lord knoweth well enough our condition, and therefore for the correcting of our high minds, it is good we ſhould be reſtrained. Yea verily, for if the Apoſtles had ſéene into heauen, wée woulde haue taken occaſion thereby to haue growne hautie: as wée ſée in déede we are thereto ouermuch giuen. For we are too too mad headed, and without modeſtie, to deſire to vnderſtand euen thoſe ſecretes of God, which hée woulde not haue vs to knowe. And therefore it was expedient that this clowde ſhoulde be betwéene them and him. By this then wée are let to vnderſtande, that we muſt be humbled, and not be ſo arrogant as to aſcend vp into the heauens to ſearch after the workes of the Lord. And this inſtruction are we to learne by this place.</p>
               <p>Now, it is ſaide that there appeared two Angels: but Saint Luke calleth them <hi>men,</hi> according to the common maner of the Scripture: For becauſe Angels are naturally ſpirituall, wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſée them, except they ſhewe themſelues in ſome viſible ſhape. Wée ſée now the reaſon why our Lorde would from the beginning haue them appeare in mens ſhapes: Howbeit he left alwaies ſom token with them that they might bée knowne to be Angels. For if we vnderſtand the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be only as mortall men, we would neuer do
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7663:172"/> them that honor which vnto them apperteined, which woulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from the giuing credite vnto their meſſage. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God alwaies ſet a marke on them, that we might know them. For beholde, why it is héere ſaide,<note place="margin">Iohn. 20.12.</note> that they were clad in white ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell: and in the reſurrection alſo of Ieſus Chriſte they appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in white garments. Héerein then the mind of our Lord was to declare that wée ſhould reuerently receiue them, and vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly credite their meſſage. Thus, I ſay, we ſée, why S. Luke heere ſayth, that they were apparrelled in white garments.</p>
               <p>Now we are héere to note all the circumſtances of this matter, for God would not haue any one of them to be loſt, nor yet ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlipt: ſuch is his infinite wiſedome ouer all the worlde. If the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels then, haue ſuch a Maieſtie in their appearance vnto vs, what ſhall we ſay of the glorious appearing of our good God? For, the brightneſſe of God his glorious Maieſtie, is not only as the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Sunne, but farre excelling the brightneſſe of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Sunnes, if they ſhoane héere all at once in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world. So then, whenas wée ſée that the Angels ſhould be ſo precious vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, as that wée ſhould ſo wonderfully reuerence them, we muſt conſider what the Maieſtie of God is to bée ſpoken of, yea euen the very thinking of him, ſhoulde cauſe vs meruellouſly to worſhip him, and acknowledge our ſelues to be no body, in reſpect of him, who is maieſtie it ſelfe. And thus wée ſée what is mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by the ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the maieſtie of Angels, although they appeare but in mens ſhapes? Now let vs come to their ſpéech, <hi>Yee men of Galilee</hi> (ſay they) <hi>why ſtand yee gazing vp into heauen?</hi> It is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly thought that the Apoſtles were héere called Galileans by way of reproche: for wée ſée that the Galileans were of no greate eſtimation in the world And therfore this was the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that went of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as if the Angels ſhould haue ſaid, O yée miſerable blockheads, know ye not that as hée is aſcended vp into heauen, that ſo hee ſhall alſo come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine? Howbeit you perceiue not why this was thus ſpoken, and in this ſenſe. And therefore, let vs vnderſtand, that the angels called the Apoſtles galileans, becauſe they were taken to be ſuch, &amp; Ieſus Chriſt was alſo ſo called: and when y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Diſciples ſhould haue béen accuſed to be of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> company of Ieſus Chriſt, it was aſked the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">

And ſo were the Apoſtles called héere Galileans, becauſe they were taken, for thoſe countrie men.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, it is not without cauſe that the Angels héere reproue them: For they knewe that Ieſus Chriſte ſhould aſcend into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, becauſe he had many times foretold them, and alſo ſaid vnto them,<note place="margin">Iohn. 16.<hi>7.</hi>
                  </note> It is expedient for you that I depart hence, For if I goe not away, the comforter wil not come vnto you: but if I depart, I wil ſend him vnto you. And therfore it muſt néeds be that they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten it, ſéeing they ſtoode gazing vp into heauen, to ſée the iſſue thereof. For (as I haue already ſaid) he had told them that it was expedient that he ſhoulde depart from them, and had alſo foretolde them that he muſt reigne, and that they ſhoulde ſerue him, héere in the meane time. Hée had likewiſe foretold them that he muſt ſit at the right hand of God his Father, to make interceſſion for all the faithfull: but they rightly ſhewed that they had cleane forgotten whatſoeuer hée had ſo oftentimes manifeſted vnto them.</p>
               <p>Now, this their ignorance ſhould ſerue vs for a good aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For this was not ſpoken only for their cauſe, but for ours alſo.

And therefore, if wée will ſéeke for him now, wée muſt doe it by faith, which ſurpaſſeth all mens vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. This then is the firſt point of this place that is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie the obſeruation. For ſince we naturally haue our mindes ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led héere belowe, it would goe very hardly with vs, if wée ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly bent not our ſelues, whenas wée ſhoulde heare the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte ſpoken of. And in déede, wee ſée that this is already come to paſſe, For although hée be aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into heauen, and that it is written, that hee ſhall come downe héere below euen as hée was ſeene to aſcende, yet are there greate numbers of ſuche as call them ſelues Chriſtians,

Nowe when I ſay that we are giuen to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether earthly minded, it is becauſe wee would eftſoones draw god and whatſoeuer knowledge we haue of him, to vs, and make him like vnto our ſelues. Wée ſee then by experience, that we would haue Ieſus Chriſte continually in the fleſh with vs: But wee ſee on the other ſide that the Angels would put vs beſide ſuch ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for they ſaid, yée men of Galilée, why ſtand yee gazing vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen. In very déede, if wée wil ſéeke for our Lorde Ieſus, we muſt lift vp our mindes vnto heauen, but we muſt not ſéek for him after our owne mindes and vnderſtandings, and therefore faith muſt at this preſent beare rule ouer vs. For, doe not we know, that faith ſurmounteth all mens reaſon? Neither haue wée ſuche a benefit by inheritance, but it is a grace giuen vs of God to amend our nature. Wée muſt then ſéeke for our Lorde Ieſus but not with our eyes, eares, feete, nor handes, But it is faith that muſte ſupply all our wantes. Euen ſo, whenas wee ſhall haue right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderſtoode this place, we ſhalbe ſufficiently fenced agaynſt all popiſh fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taſies, where they ſay by a peece of bread, Behold héere is God: &amp; thinke he may be cloſed vp like a Puppet, Wee ſhall, I ſay, be ſufficiently fenced againſt them, whenas we vnderſtand, that it is ſaid, that we muſt not ſeek for him according to a natural mans reaſon, but by faith.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, wee are admoniſhed, not to ſlacke the raines to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and thinke that we cannot haue God corporally with vs. And becauſe we haue béen continually infected with this vice, wee ought the more wiſely to beware of this point.<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:7663:174"/> muſt we, when he offereth himſelfe vnto vs, imagine of him according to our fantaſie.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, ſince we knowe that hée is aſcended into this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly glory. Let vs marke why he is there. Let vs in the firſt place remember vs of that which is ſaid, That he is not entred into the holy place made with mans handes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24.</note> but that he is in heauen, and therevpon maketh interceſſion for vs vnto God his Father: ſo that whenſoeuer we pray vnto God, hée will not heare vs, with out Ieſus Chriſt were there in our name: &amp; being there, hée is our Interceſſour, and is the cauſe that our praiers come vnto him, and that they are hearde, euen as though we our ſelues were priueled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, to ſpeake our mindes, and powre out our heartes before God. And this is it which wée reade in the Epiſtle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exo.</hi> 28.</note> That as the high Prieſt entred into the Sanctuary for all men. Euen ſo, ſince Ieſus Chriſte is in heauen, wée ſhoulde bée certaine and ſure, that hée maketh interceſſion for vs. For, when the high Prieſte entred into the Sanctuary, hée had vpon his head the names of the children of Iſraell, and before him hée had twelue ſtones, which ſignified the twelue Tribes of Iſraell: which declared, that although hée went in alone, yet hee did it for all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Since then Ieſus Chriſte is entred into heauen, and beareth vs there, although wee bee, as it were bruite beaſtes: and carrieth vs alſo before him, to declare that he hath vs in his heart: we muſt not then pray vnto God doubtingly, but be aſſured that our praiers ſhall alwaies be acceptable vnto him, becauſe Ieſus Chriſte ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vnto him for vs.</p>
               <p>Now, if this had béene before time throughly vnderſtood, there had not béen ſuch ſtoare of Superſtition in Popery. For, what is the cauſe that they haue ſo many Patrones? Why runne they ſo faſte vnto the Virgin Mary? Forſooth, becauſe they neuer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood wherefore it was that Ieſus Chriſte aſcended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, For if they had knowne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hée had aſcended to bée our Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour, they would neuer haue ſaide that they had béen vnworthie to haue offered vp their prayers vnto God: and therfore had néede of Aduocates: But they had knowne y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſince Ieſus Chriſt is there in our name, and in our behalfe, wée might there haue acceſſe vnto
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7663:174"/> him, without either Patrones or Aduocates. And this wee haue to vnderſtande in the firſt place.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, hée aſcended, to the end that ſitting at the right hand of God his Father, he might gouerne the worlde: and ſo gouerneth it, as that he alwayes aſſiſteth his faithfull ones, and hath a ſpecial care ouer them.</p>
               <p>Now, if Ieſus Chriſt had continually abode with vs, ouer and beſides that we had béen more giuen to ſuperſtition, hée had not had the power to haue had all thinges vnder his ſubiection. In déede hée might haue had it: But we ſpeake not nowe of him, but according to that order which hée hath ſet downe in his Goſpell. And to ſay the trueth, it were a fooliſhe kinde of reaſoning to ſay, that otherwiſe hee had not béen able to haue done either this thing or that, becauſe his power is infinite. But yet he ſaide after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, that God had giuen him all power and authoritie: and this is alſo our beliefe,<note place="margin">

And although our Lord Ieſus had from eternitie all power, yet wée ſaide not, that hée ſitteth at the right hande of God, vntill ſuch time as we ſaide that he was aſcended into heauen. Wée ſée then that he had this preheminence ouer all, after that he was aſcended. And héere wee haue to note, that the principalitie which Ieſus Chriſte had, is for vs: becauſe hée hath no néede of it himſelfe, ſéeing hée is euerlaſting with the Father. But what? hée is at the right hande of God in our nature, And it is to this end, that wée might bée aſſured wée ſhall take no harme being vnder his protection. In very déed, hée is wel co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented that our fleſhe ſhoulde bée troubled, and that wée ſhoulde bée wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in many miſeries: But what then?

               <p>Euen ſo, ſince he is aſcended into heauen for vs, let vs note, that we ought not to feare any thing ſo long as we are in this world. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, wée are ſubiect to ſo many miſeries, as that it is lamentable to ſée our eſtate (for we are more then miſerable:) and yet wee muſt not be abaſhed for all that nor yet regarde our owne perſons, but wée muſt haue a reſpect to our head, who is alredy in Heauen, and ſaye, although I be weake, yet beholde Ieſus Chriſt is ſtronge i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make mée ſtand vpright: although I be féeble, yet loe, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is my force: and although I bee full of miſeries, yet is Ieſus Chriſt in immortall glorye, and looke what hée hath, ſhall one day be mine, and I ſhall bee partaker of all his benefites.</p>

                  </note>True it is, that the Deuill is called the Prince of this worlde: but what then? yet Ieſus Chriſt keepeth hym ſhort: becauſe hée is King both of heauen and earth.</p>
               <p>Beholde the Deuils that are aboue in the ayre who warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs: but what of al that?

Beholde, the ſonne of God is my head, in whom there is no chaunge, and therefore I muſt truſt to that.</p>
               <p>Thus wee ſée what a regarde wée muſt haue vnto his aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and make it profitable vnto our ſelues. Let vs now come to the ſaying of the Angels, <hi>yee ſhall ſee him come downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, euen as you haue ſeene him goe vp:</hi> meaning that wée ſhould not looke for him, vntill he come to the day of iudgement. Now, this ſhoulde not onely plucke all ſuperſtition vp by the rootes out of vs, but alſo draw vs to heauen vnto him. Howbeit wee haue already ſaide,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Col.</hi> 3.2.</note> that we muſt not ſéeke for him but by Faith. And ſince it is ſo, let vs harken to the ſaying of Saint Paule to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians, Séeing Chriſt Ieſus your head dwelleth in Heauen, in whom is all your lyfe, it is méete that your affection ſhould bée on thinges aboue, although your bodies be héere. Wherefore, ſince wée know Ieſus Chriſt to be aboue, wée muſt learne to forſake the world, and be vnited to him. There is a great ſpace betwixt him and vs: &amp; therefore it were impoſſible for vs to be ioyned together except we ſhould vſe the meane which S. Paule telleth vs, which is, to mortefye theſe earthlye members: as, Fornication, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7663:175"/> couetouſnes, gluttonie, pride, enuy, and al ſuch like: would we be partakers of this Aſcenſion? Then muſt we not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate our ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. But how ſhould we be ioyned vnto him? Forſooth, wee muſt mortifie theſe earthly members, and all other thinges that holde vs héere belowe. Some are geuen to vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſome to reuenge, ſome to gluttonie, and other ſome to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other vices.</p>
               <p>Now then, as faith looketh vpward, euen ſo muſt our affections follow, to the end we might forſake the world, and al other things whatſoeuer which may any way hinder vs from béeing vnited vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our head. Héere wée ſée what is meant by this ſaying, <hi>That he will come in ſuch ſort as he was ſeene to goe vp into Heauen,</hi> to the end wée might learne héereby to ioyne vnto him with al the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of our heart. By this, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Angels had no pretence nor colour to ſpeake either of the apparrel of Ieſus Chriſt, eyther yet of anie other things: as many fantaſtical braynes doe, ſéeking after things neyther requiſite nor yet profitable to ſaluation: But the ſpéech of the Angels was to this purpoſe, to ſhew that he would come in viſible maner.</p>
               <p>As if they ſhould haue ſaid vnto the Apoſtles, it gréeueth you that your maiſter is taken from out of your company: howbeit let not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gréeue you: becauſe you ſhall ſée him come againe in ſuch immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal glorie, as yée now ſée him. Nowe the Papiſtes haue other pretie childiſh ſubtleties, ſaying, that their GOD is in their maſſe, and and make ſuch ſport with him there, euen as they luſt. Indéed ſay they, it is very true that Ieſus Chriſt wil come viſibly and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly, to iudgement: But yet ſay they, at this preſent he commeth cloſely and couertly. Surely, he commeth daylie vnto vs: and it is not for nothing, that the Scripture ſaith the GOD viſiteth vs: and it is alſo wel ſaid of vs, that the Goſpel is a teſtimonie of his preſence.</p>
               <p>But let vs marke how it is that hée dwelleth with vs. Indéed, S. Paule ſaith, that he dwelleth in vs by faith.<note place="margin">1. Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> And therefore let vs not geue place vnto our fooliſhe dolteries, but vnderſtande it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the meaning of S. Paule, ſaying, Knowe yée not that you are the Temple of the liuing GOD, which dwelleth in you? And ſo as God is inuiſibly euery where, and in all thinges, euen ſo Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb facs="tcp:7663:176"/> Chriſt communicateth himſelfe with vs.</p>
               <p>And therefore, when wée are vnited to him, our ſoules are fedde with the very ſubſtance of his bodie (although he be in heauen) but it is through the operation of faith &amp; of the holie Ghoſt. For Ieſus Chriſt commeth not downe corporally. Wherfore, the papiſts are doltiſhly ignorant, when they ſay that he commeth cloſely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth himſelfe vnder the bread and wine, playing bo péepe. Nowe ſince we know the meaning of theſe wordes, let vs apply them to our vſe: we haue ſaide that the Angels promiſed the Apoſtles (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhoulde not thinke that they had loſt his preſence) that like as they had ſéene him aſcend into heauen, euen ſo hee ſhoulde come downe agayne. For, what ſhould his deſcending, and the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of his death and paſſion, do vs good if we hoped not to ſée him againe? But ſéeing it was promiſed vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhould come againe to gather vs together, &amp; vnite vs to himſelfe, what a notable comfort is this for vs. And therefore this was not ſpoken only in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of the Apoſtles, but alſo for our behoofe: and herein reſteth our comfort, that although we are ſeparated from him a great long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of, yet wil he ſhew himſelfe for our redemption. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wée may boldly lift vp our heades, and ouercome whatſoeuer griefes may come vnto vs.</p>
               <p>By this we may very wel iudge whether we beléeue in Ieſus Chriſt or not. For when we heare it ſaid, that he wil come againe, and then reioyce at it, and féele his comming in our heartes, it is a token that we haue a true beliefe in him. But contrariwiſe, if wée ſtande in doubte of that day, and haue a mynde to put it of, if it were poſſible, this is a true token of our infidelitie. Wée ſée then, that faith at this day is very rare to bee founde in all the worlde. For, to heare the day of his comming ſpoken of, ſhould bée a greate comforte to vs: becauſe it is the day of our redemption, as Paule to the Romanes ſaith.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Howbeit there are very few that beléeue it. But if we bee ſorie and grieued to heare it ſpoken that that day will come, is this a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that we hope Ieſus Chriſt to bee our Redéemer? Surely our redemption was purchaſed by his death: but yet when wee ſhall be ridde of this bodie, no doubte of it wee ſhall then bee ridde of the bondage of ſinne.</p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:7663:176"/>
               <p>Loe, what an acceptable thing death ſhould be vnto vs. Howbéeit, becauſe the vniuerſall redemption ſhal not be vntil the latter day, we ought to grone, as all the Creatures grone looking for that day, becauſe they are ſubiect to corruption by reaſon of our ſinnes, and deſire to bée deliuered thereof.</p>
               <p>Wée ſée then that heauen and earth, and all the reſt of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures within them, doe deſire the appearing of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: and ſhall not wee be more aſhamed, if wée haue no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſire of his comming, then in ſenſible beaſtes? For wée, haue not onely the knowledge which God hath giuen vs, as mortall men, but hée hath alſo giuen vs an vnderſtanding to wiſhe and deſire his comming. And therefore,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.28.</note> this is a verie notable true ſigne of infidelitie, when as wée haue no deſire to ſée that day: and beſides, if wee rere not vp our heades ſo often as wée heare this ſaying pronounced, we ſufficiently declare that we haue no fayth in Chriſt Ieſus. Moreouer, as the faythfull are comforted by this ſentence, euen ſo muſt the wicked féele an inward feare of this comming. And although they make a ieſt at it, yet doeth feare and trembling poſſeſſe their heartes: which is this, that our Lorde Ieſus putteth them ouer vnto his iudgement.</p>
               <p>And the reaſon why many men take Ieſus Chriſt for their Iudge,<note place="margin">Iohn. 19.37</note> is this: becauſe they haue no will to receiue him, when as God his meaning is, to giue them him to be their Redéemer. In verie déede, there are a number which at this day, make but a laughing game thereat: yet ſhall they neither will nor chooſe,<note place="margin">Apoc. 1.7.</note> but feele his heauy hande whom they had perſed. For there are ſome ſuche men, vnto whom if the iudgement of God be named, that wil an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere and ſay, Well Syr well, we ſhall be ſure to ſée him, but not vntill hée come. As certeine of my gentle ſcoffers, ſcoffed here vpon Tueſday laſt paſt, who not onely made light account, and ſet them ſelues againſt God in the Tauernes, but alſo made a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter héere, of their impyetie and ſhameleſneſſe: and becauſe they woulde ſhewe them ſelues to be lyke the moſt impudent whores of the Stewes, they came and ſcoffed at God and his word, euen in the Church, in the preſence of all his faythfull. Well let them ſcoffe at him and ſpare not, yet ſhall they féele him, I ſay, whom they had pearſed.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7663:177"/>
               <p>And let them be ſure that he will come, yea that he will come, For he is not aſcended vp into heauen, to ſuffer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wicked ones to ſcoffe at him, but that hee will ſurely be reuenged of them: and kéepeth a regiſter of all their ſcoffes and ſcornes. And ſince they wil not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly come to a reckoning, they ſhall neither will nor chooſe but receiue iudgement with their fathers and brothers, the Deuilles. Nowe, ſince this doctrine is deliuered vnto vs for our inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> let vs in Gods name learne to humble our ſelues, and worſhip Ieſus Chriſt: for ſince he is Prince and Gouernour of the Angels, whom they obey, let vs follow them for company. And beſides, let vs be well aſſured, that we may boldly pray vnto him, ſince hée ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth for vs before God his Father. Moreouer, let vs comfort our ſelues, if at this day we ſuffer much, and let vs looke for that day of the Lorde, whereat our Lorde Ieſus hath promiſed to be, to v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite vs vnto him ſelfe.</p>
               <p>And according to this holie doctrine, Let vs fall downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Maieſtie of our good God, and acknowledge our offences, beſéeching him that he will not ſuffer vs to walter our ſelues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually a ſleape in them, but awake vs and vnite vs vnto his Sonne, And ſince hée hath called vs to the knowledge of him, that it woulde pleaſe him to graunt vs the grace to profite our ſelues therein, vntill ſuch tyme as wée bée brought to that perfection, wherevnto hée calleth vs. And ſo let vs all ſay, O Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, &amp; hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father, &amp;c.</p>

Thus we ſéee, why it is, that this hiſtorie is ſet downe vnto vs in writing: to wit, becauſe, that as often as we read, or heare the word of God, we ſhould remember, that whatſoeuer is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined in the old and new Teſtament, was not deuiſed by mans brayne, but that God hath teſtified by a viſible ſigne, ſo farfoorth as was néedfull, that men were but the inſtrumentes onely of his holie ſpirite. For, as concerning Moſes and all the reſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes, they approued them ſelues to be ſent of God: Inſomuch, that if we ſhould ſtande in doubt of their doctrine, it were both vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfully and wickedly done of vs.</p>
               <p>Now, it is here ſaid, That before the Apoſtles preached the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell throughout the world, God ſent downe his holy ſpirite vpon them: to the ende we might know, that they deliuered nothing as from them ſelues, but faithfully diſtributed the thing which God had commaunded them. We ſée then to what purpoſe this preſent hiſtorie muſt ſerue our turnes: For if we were not aſſured that the Apoſtles had as it were, become newe men, and that God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them a ſure and certaine token which declared, that he allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and authorized them, what ſhould become of our faith? Surely it would be but a running opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For thus we might well enough ſay, I think ſo, or, it ſhould ſéeme ſo: But it were impoſſible for vs to ſay, that we were rightly and firmely grounded &amp; ſtayed theron. For, what is in man? And therfore becauſe this worlde is nothing but vanitie,<note place="margin">Hebr. 6.9.</note> it is very méet we ſhould, according to the ſaying of the Apoſtle, take Anker hold in heauen. Here then we ſée, how we may ryde out, all ſtormes &amp; tempeſts: ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whatſoeuer either the world, or the Deuil deuiſe, yet are they not any way able to hurt vs: But we ſhall alwayes haue a ſure faith which ſhal neuer bend one way or other, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhal take this for a grounded principle, That it is God that guideth &amp; calleth vs to himſelf, &amp; that the doctrine which is taught vs, is his pure &amp; vndoubted trueth. Loe then, to what end we muſt referre y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole ſumme &amp; effect of that which we haue at this preſent read: Forſooth, euen to this ende &amp; purpoſe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God raiſed vp this mighty winde, his meaning was to declare by a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſigne, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had choſen the twelue Apoſtles to carry the glad ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of ſaluation hither &amp; thither. In very déed, there were at that time but eleuen of them: But yet there remained alwayes a full
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7663:178"/> and ſetled number, becauſe that Matthias was placed in Iudas ſtead. Thus we ſée, that the number was filled vp which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſcattered: howbeit this want, was but for a litle while, as appeareth by the words of Saint Luke in the firſt Chapiter going before.<note place="margin">Act. <hi>1.</hi>26.</note> Here nowe we ſée the full number of the twelue Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, whom he had before choſen and marked. Neuertheleſſe, it was méete hée ſhould furniſh them with graces ſufficient and requiſite for ſo high and wonderful a calling. Wherefore it was behoueful they ſhould be faſhioned and framed from aboue, and that God ſhould miraculouſly worke in them far beyond mans reach and capacitie.</p>
               <p>Now, as for the ſound of a mightie winde or tempeſt, that, ſhewed that the holy Ghoſt came not downe vpon the Apoſtles, to make them, onely partakers of his graces, but alſo that the whole world ſhould be ſhaken therwith: For it was ſo ſpoken of by the Prophet Aggeah, in theſe words: After a while, ſaith the Lord,<note place="margin">Agge. 2.</note> I will make heauen &amp; earth tremble. Which was in déede fulfilled, in the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpel. We ſée then, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> when the holy Ghoſt deſcended, that it was not only for a handful of men, but he came down to fill all the endes and borders of the worlde: For otherwiſe, we ſhoulde haue had but a colde pull of it, as we ſay, if we were not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſuaded that God all at one time ſent his holy Ghoſt for vs alſo, for the eſtabliſhing of our fayth. Moreouer, God could haue ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the holie Ghoſt after a mylder maner, if he had liſted: But let vs note, that this ſodeine violent winde was to abate the pride of the fleſh: and againe to waken vs, becauſe we are ouer ſlow and drou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. Surely, there are two great faultes in vs, which hinder our féeling of the power of the ſpirite of God, for the ſubmitting of our ſelues vnto the Goſpell. The one, is, That wee are proude and verie preſumptuous. Nowe, all this muſt be pulde downe, that both great and ſmal of vs might humbly learn, ſo to worſhip God, as to abaſe our ſelues altogether, and be contented to liue by him and by his méere fauour &amp; grace. And therfore it is méete that this pryde which is ſo déepely rooted in our nature, ſhould be violently reformed: Becauſe we are ouer much hardened therein. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> féeleth ſuch an heauy earthly burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in himſelf, as that our mindes are altogether occupied &amp; nuſled in this world.
<pb facs="tcp:7663:179"/> To be ſhort, we are become ſo blockiſh, as it were, as that we can féele no taſte either of God, or of the power of his holie ſpirit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out we be wakened ſpite of our téethes. We ſée then why it is ſaide, that there aroſe a tempeſt, as if it had béen a violent or migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie winde. Nowe, we are to conſider in the firſt place, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoſt deſcended to ſhake, and terrefie the whole worlde, and all mankinde, that we might worſhip God with one accorde, and bée obedient vnto him. But by the way, we muſt be wakened, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are too too blockiſh: and we muſt alſo lay aſide all arroga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that wée might be brought to obey his Maieſtie, ſéeing wée right well know that we are moſt miſerable, and no better then duſt and aſhes: yea our ſoules alſo are verie corrupt, vntil it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Lord to renue them. Moreouer, when the holie Ghoſt came downe in ſuch a likeneſſe, to wit, <hi>in clouen and firie tongues,</hi> that was the more liuely to expreſſe vnto vs, howe, God would worke, by the preaching of the Goſpell. If a man ſpeake, his voice vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth away in the ayre,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16.</note> and dyeth. Nowe, it is ſaide that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is the power of God vnto ſaluation, to all beléeuers. What? can a ſounde which flyeth in the ayre and vaniſheth, bring vs to the kingdome of heauen? There is no man liuing that is able of him ſelfe to make the leaſt flye that is: it is ſaide, That the image of God is repaired in vs,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23.</note> and that wee receiue this incorruptible ſéede, whereby we might attaine to this heauenly glorie, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions with the Angels, be tranſfigured euen into the glory and immortalitie of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and be partakers, as S. Peter ſaieth,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4.</note> of the diuine nature. And may all this be done by the voice of a man? No ſure: But it is here namely ſaide, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoſt is linked with an inſeparable bonde, vnto the word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. For, why tooke hée vpon him this ſhape of tongues? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is alwayes ſome likelihood, betwéene the viſible ſignes, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> trueth which is figured in them.</p>
               <p>And therefore we are to conſider, wherefore the holy Ghoſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the fourme of tongues: forſooth, it was to ſhew, that hée woulde be in the mouthes of the Apoſtles, and woulde giue them whatſoeuer was requiſite for the executing of their office and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: and likewiſe, ſo bleſſe their labour, as that it ſhould not be vnprofitable.</p>
               <p>Nowe, we knowe in the firſt place, that the moſt able man
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:7663:179"/> that is to be found, cannot vtter one word, without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirit of God gouerneth him. And herein, God ſheweth what we are,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3.</note> ſéeing wée are not able to open our mouthes, to ſpeake one word to his glory, which ſhall turne to any purpoſe, without it come from him.</p>
               <p>It muſt therefore néedes fall out, that the ſpirite of God gouerned the Apoſtles, for els, they had become dumbe. We ſée beſides, how groaſe headed they were: For they might haue bin more quick and ſharpe witted, but that God meant to ſhew vnto vs, as in a glaſſe, by their groaſeneſſe, what we are, vntill ſuch time as he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned vs with his grace. In déed, when the Apoſtles kept com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with our Lord Ieſus, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they tooke to be their maiſter, they verie ſoberly obeyed his doctrine: But in the meane while, what was their knowledge? without doubt, we ſée that they were verie beaſtes, inſomuch that when we conſider of them, howe litle they profited in ſo good a Schoole, their ſlackneſſe ſhould make vs aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Howbeit this their dealing hath greatly profited vs: For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, they were chaunged in the minute of an houre, whereby the grace of God hath ſhined a great deale the more, becauſe wée ſée they ſpake ſo wonderfull mightely of the ſecretes of God, whereat euerie man was abaſhed, where, before, it was thought to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, let vs conſider of their power and conſtancy: ſurely, they all quayled, and it ſhould ſéeme that their fayth was dead and of no force. For, mark how Peter euen one of the chiefeſt of them villainouſly forſooke his Maiſter, and yelded himſelf the bondſlaue of Satan. Wherefore it was God that muſt put too his hand: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was impoſſible for any man to helpe it. And ſo, let vs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that it was not without cauſe that the ſpirite of God appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the likeneſſe of tongues, becauſe it was a declaration, that God, by that meane had allowed and ſealed vp the doctrine of the Goſpell, to the ende we might reuerently, and humbly receiue it, and not reaſon from whence it came: ſéeing God hath ſtretched foorth his arme, and declared him ſelfe to be the Authour thereof. And beſides, it is not without cauſe, that they were clouen and fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie tongues. For we know, how mankinde had deuided it ſelfe, by the eſtraunging of it ſelfe from God. And the platforme that was layde for the building vp of the Tower of Babylon,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 11 7.</note> was the cauſe that men vnderſtood not one an other, nor yet ſpake one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<pb facs="tcp:7663:180"/> ſo that they thought, that God of verie anger had deuided them. Howe falleth it out then, that the Apoſtles hauing been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes encloſed, as ſimple and vnlearned people, in this corner of Iudea, were able to publiſh the Goſpell throughout the worlde, if God had not accompliſhed that which before hee had promiſed: to wit,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 19.18.</note> that all languages and nations ſhould know him? In déede, it was ſaid that all men ſhould ſpeake the Hebrew tongue, that they might agrée together in one true fayth: But it is more manifeſtly ſet foorth when as it is ſaide, that all the faithfull, of what nation ſoeuer they were, ſhould call vpon God with one accord, and crye Abba,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.15.</note> Father: notwithſtanding their ſundry languages. Thus we ſée how the ſpirite of God would poure abroad the power of his tongues,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.14.</note> to the end that all men might call vpon the name of God, that we might all, be made partakers together of this couenant of ſaluation which apperteined onely to the Iewes, vntill the wall was broken downe. And herein we ſée the vnſpeakeable goodneſſe of God, in conuerting of yll into good. For if we ſéeke for the cauſe, why there are ſo many languages in the worlde, we muſt néedes confeſſe it to be the curſe of God, and yet herein appeareth his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull fatherly goodneſſe and mercy, to haue the glad tydinges of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting life to be caried through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world in all languages. Thus we ſée howe God hath conuerted euill into good. And therefore we haue hereby the more to glorifie and bleſſe his holy name, becauſe wee knowe that the diuerſitie of tongues haue not letted him to declare vnto all the worlde that hée meaneth to receiue all ſuch as had before eſtraunged them ſelues from him, and thruſt them all, as it were into his boſome, vntill ſuche time as hée hath brought them together into the heauenly enheritance. And thus much for this. Howbeit, this were not enough to haue the Goſpell preached, and to haue God to be knowne all the world ouer, without this doctrine had foorthwith power, liuely to touch mens heartes, that they might be brought to obedience. This then was the cauſe why the fyrie tongues appeared. Yea verely, For in the firſt place, we had néede to be purged, becauſe we are altogether corrupt and defiled. For let our mindes be ſearched, our affections and deſires examined, and they will be founde altogether ſoule and ſtinking. And therefore we muſt be as men new perboyled, that God might purge vs after a ſtraunge maner.</p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:7663:180"/>
               <p>Agayne, wée are on the other ſide as colde as may bée. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wée had néede to bée enflambed with the loue of GOD: and where wée are wholly geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the world, let vs looke vp into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which muſt bée brought to paſſe by his word. Thus we ſée, to what purpoſe this hiſtorie ſerueth vs at this day: In the firſt place, it is to the end we might receiue the doctrine of the Goſpel, as a certain and vndoubted truth: becauſe it beareth about with it the marke of God, is ſealed with his holy ſpirite, and is alſo an excellent teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of our adoption. Wée ſée then how we are brought to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by reaſon that God hath allowed, and confirmed his Goſpel, to the ende our faith ſhoulde not be changeable, and wée become wauering, for the altering of our mynde and opinion: But that wée ſhoulde goe on continually in the right way, vntil ſuch time as we haue finiſhed our courſe. Here we ſée howe by the power of the ſpirite of God our faith ſhal ouercome the worlde.<note place="margin">Coloſ. 2.23.</note> For (as wée haue already ſaid, and as S. Paule alſo ſaith) if we ſhould buylde vpon the wiſedome of men, what ſhould become of it? But ſo long as we haue the ſpirite of God for our ground woorke, let vs be ſure neuer to bee ſhaken. In the meane while, wée haue to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider with our ſelues, becauſe God maketh vs at this day Partakers of the thing which we haue of late declared: that is, let vs call vpon him with one accord (although I ſay we are deuided in tongues) &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides let vs become new me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through the doctrine which is preached vnto vs: in ſuch ſort as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we might know, that there is fire in it to change and cleanſe our minds, wits, &amp; hearts, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al the corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of this world. For although Gods choſen people are brought home agayne by the meane of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſpel, yet ſée wée the enemies of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth become more cruel and rebellious, ſo that it is euen ſufficient to ſet all the worlde together by the eares, as by experience at this day may bée ſéene. For during the time that the Goſpel was not prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, all the world liued careleſly and quietly: and there were not many queſtions nor diſputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And how ſo? Forſooth becauſe the diuel then raigned without gainſaying. But when our Lord Ieſus appeared with the pure doctrine of the Goſpel, what ſkirmiſhing was there foorthwith. Wée ſée alſo at this day, what contentions there are amongſt thoſe which beare the name of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>So much the rather therefore are wée to beſéech the Lorde, to
<pb facs="tcp:7663:181"/> make vs féele wherefore the holie Ghoſt deſcended vpon his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and to beſéech him alſo to graunt vs that grace, that we may obediently teſtifie that it was to gather vs together, that where before we were ſeuered, wee might nowe bee conioyned vnto our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, as members of his bodie, and let him bee our true head.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, for the attayning thereto, we are alſo to beſéech him ſo to ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthen vs as that our hearts may be ſet on fire, where now they are key colde: and alſo to perboyle vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the corruptions of our nature might be ſcoombed of, and to be ſhort, that we might bée ſo renued, as that wee might be quite and cleane ſeparated from the worlde. Wée ſhal oftentimes ſée how the word of God becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a fire, but it is after another ſort, euen to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſume thoſe which ſpeake againſt it: according to that ſaying of the prophet Ieremiah, where he ſheweth that it fared euen ſo with the children of Iſrael, whom the worde of God conſumed like ſtraw and ſtubble for their wickedneſſe and rebellion. And I beſéech you let vs ſée, how many at this day can pleade not guiltie becauſe they ſtubbornely lifte vp themſelues againſt God, like foming wild beaſts: or els ſome ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and profane men, who ſet themſelues againſt God, not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any authoritie or honour vnto his holy word? In very déede theſe people ſhal neuer make the worde of GOD vnprofitable, not yet without power, but it will conſume them like a whot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming fire, to cender and aſhes. Let vs therefore make this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, why it was the wil of God to haue the holie Ghoſt appeare in fyery tongues: Surely, it was to this end and purpoſe, that the faithfull might vnderſtande that they had great néede to be ſo tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to the quicke, as that GOD might chaunge and renue them.</p>
               <p>Thus wee ſee in ſumme, what wee are to conſider of, for the better applying of this hiſtorie to our vſe. Howbeit, ouer and beſides al this, let vs marke the twoo principall poyntes of fayth: and then let vs returne to our ſelues, and vnderſtand what wée woulde doe, if GOD wrought not therein. Firſt of all, there is in faith, knowledge and certayntie, and next of all, is aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and conſtancie.</p>
               <p>Now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God ſpeaketh, we are eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deaf at his words, bicauſe our
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7663:183"/> mindes are altogether ſet vpon this world: and indéed we wil ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all the wiſedome that is conteined in the Goſpell to be verie fooliſhneſſe, vntill ſuch time as God hath enlightened vs.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.</note> In the firſt place therefore, God muſt open our hearres for the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this trueth, &amp; for ſticking thereto, otherwiſe we ſhall be both deafe, blockiſh, &amp; without apprehending of this word. Thus much then for this point. Nowe, for the ſecond point, it ſhall ſtand vs in hand ſtoutly to withſtand all the aſſaultes &amp; attempts wherewith Satan aſſaileth vs: and to be well armed &amp; appointed for the ſame purpoſe. And how is it poſſible for vs to be ſo, vntill ſuch time as God hath put to his helping hand? and there is no way to help that but by the onely power of the holy Ghoſt. And therefore, although we be an hundreth times taught the Goſpel, yet forſomuch as wée are light &amp; fickle brained, we ſhould ſoone be pulled from it, if God did not ſtrengthen vs therin: yea and at this day it is ſo full of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils &amp; threates, as that the ſilly faithfull ſoules can no ſooner open their mouthes to call vpon God, but that they are foorthwith, at the point, to be put to death: neither can they any ſooner confeſſe their faith, but that the fire is lightned vtterly to aboliſh the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Since then it is ſo mightily ſtood a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt, as that they who ſhould defend the Chriſtian faith, Satan hath enflamed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if it were poſſible, vtterly to ouerthrow al, muſt not God therfore ſhew his power herein? We are then at this day taught by experience, &amp; admoniſhed, what néede we haue to put in practiſe the thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined in this hiſtory, &amp; thervpon pray vnto the Lord, &amp; beſeech him, that as his wil &amp; pleaſure was to teſtifie vnto vs the comming of the Goſpel into the world, which was wrought by the power of his holy ſpirit, euen ſo likewiſe that euery of vs for our part might feele y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame. And, as we ought fully to be perſuaded and reſolued, that the word which is preached to vs is not of men: Euen ſo alſo ought not the interpretation therof, as S. Peter ſaith,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet. 1.</hi> 20</note> he handled according to euery mans fantaſtical head: for he ſetteth down theſe two pointes together, ſaying, Since the ſpirite of God hath ſpoken by his holy Prophets, we for our parts alſo, when wée wold vnderſtand that, which is deliuered vnto vs by their doctrine, ought to lay aſide our owne naturall reaſon, &amp; fantaſies, in ſaying, It ſéemeth thus to mée, &amp; I thinke ſo: &amp; ſoberly &amp; diſcréetly, beſéech the Lorde to gouerne, and lead vs by his holie ſpirite vnto the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb facs="tcp:7663:184"/> of his word, wherof he him ſelfe is Authour. And thus much for this: now, forſomuch as, at this day we ſee, how the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill hath filled the world with a number of Sectes, ſo that there are many heretikes which ceaſe not to trouble and infect the puritie of the Goſpell: and beſides, ſince there are ſuch a ſort of contemners of God, and of Maſtife Curres, in whom is neither fayth nor yet religion: ſo much the rather had we néede, continually to offer our ſelues before the Lord, to the end he might enlighten vs with his trueth, and we to be ſo vnited vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, as that nothing may be able to ſeparate vs from him. And againe, let vs beſéech him to graunt vs a ſtout and conſtant minde vnto the end: Becauſe, that although the enemies of the truth be neuer ſo fierce, yet that we may notwithſtanding perſeuere &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue ſtill therin, that Satan therby might be va<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quiſhed. Neither muſt we be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful onely for our ſelues, but alſo, think of others. In déed, it is an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie matter for vs here at this day, to make co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion of our faith: for we ſée not the bright ſtambing fires before vs, as our poore brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do, neither do we heare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> terrible threats wherwith they are threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, nor yet féele we the tempeſts &amp; garboiles that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ight vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their heads: &amp; yet are we the members of one bodie. Now, what is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why we thus aſſemble our ſelues together, but to the ende wée might be ioyned together in a true brotherhood, ſince God of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodneſſe hath adopted vs for his children, &amp; daily witneſſeth vnto vs, that he will be our Father? And therfore it is good reaſon that we ſhould be careful for theſe who are as it were, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Wolfes chapes, &amp; daily féele ſtraunge troubles: let vs haue this compaſſion vpon them at the leaſt, as to beſéech the lord to ſuccour and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then them in all their conflicts, ſo farfoorth as ſhall be néedfull: and not ſuffer them to be confounded: So that howſoeuer Satan go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about to ouerthrow their fayth, yet that it would pleaſe him to giue them patience and perſeuerance vnto the ende. We had néede alſo to be admoniſhed of the thinges that are euen at this day come to paſſe: For, if euer there were any perſecution, at any tyme at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, it is euen nowe, and eſpecially, in one place the furie of the enemies of God, hath within theſe eight dayes béene ſo ſet on fire, as that they haue taken greater occaſion the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer hath hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to yet been ſéene, to execute their crueltie againſt the poore fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſoules of God. We ſée alſo howe Satan hath poſſeſſed theſe
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7663:184"/> curſed Tyrauntes, inſomuch that they are become ſo frantike, as that there is no hope any way of their recouerie. And euen there, are our poore afflicted brethren thruſt out for a pray, being wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and narrowly looked vnto, and it may very well bée ſéene y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is the greateſt preparation for fury and cruelty that may po<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſſibly bée thought on: ſo that the obſtinacy of the wicked againſt God, is more incorrigible then euer yt was. This then is our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite, that God in the meane while hath graunted vs leaſure earneſtly to conſider of it, and to put this hiſtorie in practiſe which here we ſée: to wit, that ſince the holy Ghoſt deſcended vpon them who were of one accord (as Saint Luke maketh mention) Let vs learne to aſſemble our ſelues: and although we be far from blows, yet let vs ioyne our ſelues with them that fight, by ayding them in their conflictes, with our prayers, and ſupplications: and that in ſuch ſort, as that the ſpirit of God may be the guider of the whole, and we for our part, ſo zealouſly enflamed, that in ſtead of our key coldneſſe, that we may feruently and earneſtly call vpon our God. And as for our brethren who haue néede to be confirmed in ſuch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaultes wherewith they are attempted, let our good God ſhew that it is he him ſelfe which worketh in them, and guideth and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, we are throughly to conſider of this ſaying, of conſent and accord, that we might be brought backe againe vnto our head, euen Ieſus Chriſt our lord. For we ſée, how plentifully the Goſpell is at this day preached: but if there were a regiſter kept of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, we ſhould finde a ſmall number of them, &amp; thin ſowne: For there are but a fewe places where the pure doctrine of God is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: and yet, where there is any Church, there are in it many co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of God, and diſſolute and prophane people, who would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect all the reſt, if God by his wonderful power preſerued them not. And beſides, there are ſome which would euen co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue ſtil in their beaſtlines. Yea, ther are ſuch a number of them at this day, as that for theſe twenty or two and twenty yeares a man cannot perceiue that they haue gone one ſtep forward in the knowledge of God: for they no more know faith, nor worſhip, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very bruit beaſts. Other ſome there are, who although they haue knowledge ſufficient, yet want courage and boldnes, and are altogether drowſie, making no reckoning either of God or of his word ſo that the number of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true ſhéepe &amp; Lambes is verie ſmall.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7663:185"/>
               <p>Now, we ſée by the way, what ſcope and elbow roome the Deuill hath all Europe ouer: for there, all his leaſings, deceits, and illuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are receiued: and the world is ſo bewitched, as that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to bring it againe in frame. We ſée how men doe not onely ſet them ſelues againſt God, &amp; wittingly blaſpheme him, but alſo are furiouſly enflamed, that a man woulde thinke they would pull the Sonne out of heauen, &amp; take his light from him. Now, when we ſée all this geare, we had need ioyne our ſelues againe vnto our head, Chriſt Ieſus our Lord. For, what is the cauſe of this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt and vngodlines, &amp; of ſo many rebellions &amp; mockeries in the world, but becauſe grace is not graunted to all men to be ledde vnder this excellent Shepheard, whom God his father hath appointed for vs. And we know that they who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he kéepeth, ſhall neuer periſh, as hée himſelf hath ſaid.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 6.39. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.28.</note> Wherfore, let vs ſubmit our ſelues vnto our lord Ieſus Chriſt, if we will féele the benefite &amp; accompliſhment of the thing which S. Luke here ſpeaketh of, to our ſaluation: to wit, that God doth not onely ſpeake to our eares, &amp; his voice reſounde in the ayre: But his doctrine alſo, pearſeth our heartes, that wée might be ſo enflamed, perboyled, &amp; renued, as that we might caſt away the corruptions of this world: So that, as we would be taken &amp; allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his people, we might in trueth call vpon our God in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are conioyned, to this end, that he might perfectly vnite vs vnto God his father. And therfore behold why this holy Table is at this preſent made readie for vs. For, as I haue before ſaid, we cannot poſſibly be partakers of any of the graces of the holy Ghoſt, but by being the members of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Now, how can we attain therto, without he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelf vnto vs, &amp; biddeth vs vpon ſuch a condition, as truely ioyneth vs vnto him: and he ſo dwelleth in vs, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whatſoeuer hée hath, is oures, whereby we might enioy the benefites which were graunted to him in our name:<note place="margin">

Let vs then know, that ſince the Supper is at this time offred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, that the meaning of our Lord Ieſus is, that we ſhoulde ſéeke all our felicitie in him. And becauſe we are very farre from him, he of his great goodneſſe commeth neare to vs.</p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:7663:181"/>
               <p>In very déed, hée leaueth not his heauenly glory: For we muſt not thinke that hée deſcendeth héere below (as the Papiſts imagine) to beſtowe his body and blood vpon vs: But although wée are farre from him, yet ceaſeth hée not to refreſh vs with his body and blood, neyther let vs leaue ſo farre foorth as ſhall be néedefull for vs to bée perfectly vnited to him.</p>
               <p>Nowe, marke why I ſay, perfectly, although in very déede hée maketh vs go on in ſome meaſure: but yet how euer it is, let not vs leaue to ioyne our ſelues to him. And let vs vnderſtand that hee will not deceiue vs of our hope ſéeing hee hath declared vnto vs, that hée is our head, and wée his members: and that if wée ſuffer him to gouerne and guide vs, wée ſhall finde him to bée a good and ſure guide: and the power of his holy Spirite to bée infinite to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend vs. In the firſt place then, when wée come to this holy Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Let vs vnderſtand that it is a ſecrete, ſurpaſſing our capacities and therefore wee muſt héere giue place vnto faith. And let vs know, that the thing which wée cannot conceiue and vnderſtand, is notwithſtanding accompliſhed by the ſecret and inuiſible grace of the holy Ghoſt: for, ſée how we are made partakers of the body &amp; blood of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, ſince hée dwelleth in vs, and that wée are truly and in déed his body, let vs not doubt, but that whatſoeuer Iſaiah ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, of the graces of the holy Ghoſte, they belong and are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vnto vs, In very déede, wee receiue not the holy Ghoſte per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly:<note place="margin">

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is not without cauſe that our Lorde Ieſus hath ſo diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted it to vs by certaine and ſure portions and degrées: For, it is néedefull that his power ſhoulde bee made perfect in our weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to the end wée might hang alwayes vpon him,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9.</note> and carefully call vpon his holy name: that wée myght alſo bée humbled, becauſe wee know that there are many things in vs which may be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Wée ſee then that wee ſhould vnderſtand, that Ieſus Chriſt dwelleth not in vaine in vs: becauſe hee will effectually witneſſe vnto vs, that his holy Spirite will powre foorth his power to ſtrengthen vs in him, that we might forſake this world, and come vnto heauen. It is ſaid in that place of Iſaiah, That the Spirit of wiſedome reſted vpon him: by which hée meaneth to ſhew, that
<pb facs="tcp:7663:182"/> we are nothing but darkneſſe and miſerable blinde foules: and in ſteed of thinking our ſelues to be both able and ſkilfull, wee ſhal alwaies peruert and falſifie the trueth of God, vntill ſuch time as hée inlightened vs, and graunted vs an heauenly cléerenes, which commeth not vnto vs either by birth or yet by inheritance. And it is ſaid beſides, that he hath the ſpirite of the feare of God: and al becauſe our deſires are ſo many enimies againſt the will of God, vntill ſuch time as they be refourmed,<note place="margin">Rom <hi>8.</hi>7.</note> and altogether chaunged. Beſides, it is ſaid alſo that he hath the ſpirite of power, to the ende we might vnderſtand our weakeneſſe, ſo that we coulde not chooſe but quaile, if we were not ſtrengthened from aboue, wée ſhoulde then feele al theſe things, whenas we ſhould come to the receiuing of the teſtimonie which is héere ſet downe vnto vs: and we ſhould be perſuaded that as mortall men diſtribute the bread and wine, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo will our Lord Ieſus worke therein, becauſe it is done by his authoritie &amp; in his name: &amp; is no deuiſed thing of mans braine, but that Ieſus Chriſte is the Authour thereof. Thus we ſée wherunto we muſt apply this hiſtory.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, let vs bée ſo vnited vnto this head, as that wee may worſhip our God with one heart and one mouth and in the meane while let vs ioyne our ſelues together. For it is not ſaid that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ioyned with all, in one accord Becauſe al the whole towne of Ieruſalem was an enimie vnto them: and yet although they were but few in number, and a contemptible people, they ceaſed not to perſiſt, and ioyne themſelues together vnder the Enſigne or banner of God, in the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Euen ſo the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſéeing there are ſuch a number of Curre Dogges barking againſt vs, and that the Diuell raiſeth vp, ſo diuerſly, many troubles, let vs ioyne our ſelues together ſo much the more conſtantly: and let not the bond of our concord bée looſed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.18.</note> that wée may by that meane be able to ſet our ſelues againſt Satan &amp; all his ſupporters. True it is that we ought generally to ſéeke for peace with all men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception: For we ſhould loue thoſe which hate and perſecute vs, and wiſh them good, although they deſerue it not: and yet wee muſt be their enimies, for otherwiſe we ſhould ſeparate our ſelues from Ieſus Chriſte. And therefore, let vs ſet our ſelues againſt all the world and let vs beſides vnderſtand that we muſt forſake our ſelues to be ioined to our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte: and he doth vs no
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:7663:182"/> hurt nor wrong in rayſing vp the incredulous people againſt vs, whenas we goe about to make an accord amongſt our ſelues, and to ioyne and vnite our ſelues together in the name of our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: and let vs alſo vnderſtand that he alloweth and liketh of our accord, and although we are but a handfull of people, yet let vs boldly contemne the worlde, and all Satans adherents, &amp; gods enimies. And although in reſpect of them wée are nothing, let vs not doubt but that God alloweth of vs, and dwelleth amongſt vs. At what time that S. Luke deſcribed this matter here in this place the Sacrifices were vſed in the Temple as they had béene before time, and the Prieſt was there preſent in all his dignitie and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificalibus. There was alſo the common order of all their glorious and glittering ſhew, ſo that a man would haue thought that God had been tyed to this people.</p>
               <p>Now, the holy Ghoſt deſcended, but vpon one houſe, nay rather but vpon one chamber, wherein the poore fearefull Diſciples were euen like ſilly lambes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſed about with wolues. A man would haue thought that the ſtate of theſe people was miſerable: and yet ſee, the holy Ghoſt appeared vnto this little and ſimple company. Euen ſo, although we at this day be contemptible in the worlde, &amp; no great number, yet let vs not doubt but that the Sonne of God will poure out the power of his holy ſpirite vpon vs, and cauſe vs to féele his graces ſo farre foorth as he ſéeth to bée néedefull: and therfore let vs be ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented with this ineſtimable benefit, as that we enuie not the proſperity of the vngodly, &amp; enimies of God: and that hee doth vs no wrong that the worlde deſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now let vs fall downe before the Maieſtie of our good God, and acknowledge our offences, beſéeching him to forgiue vs them, to correct vs for them, &amp; wholy to rid vs of them. And ſo let vs al ſay, O Almightie God and heauenly Father. &amp;c.</p>

For beholde how the Apoſtles, who were very wel knowne to bée plaine countrie men, &amp; of baſe eſtate, ſpake diuers and ſundry forreine tongues and languages, excel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lently handling the true religion, and declaring the ſaluation which was in Chriſte Ieſus. Nowe, this thing in déede, was ſufficient to haue cauſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who heard it ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of many dayes after, to fall into a great admiration: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it could not be choſen, but that they which preſently beholde, &amp; with their owne eares heard them ſpeake, muſt néedes bee ſtirred
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:7663:185"/> vp to bée brought to the true obedience of the worde. Howbeit they would not acknowledge the workes of God, whereby they ought to haue magnified and glorified him, but euen made a ieſt at them. Well, this fault was not onely in the worlde at thoſe dayes: but wee may ſée it alſo in this our age. For God worketh ſo mightily and effectually alwaies, as that wee are no way able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend his doings: and yet for all that, wee are no whit moued to thanke him for them, but eſpecially, for that great benefite of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vs to the knowledge of his Goſpell, which hée hath largely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon vs. But co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe, do we not ſee a rabble of ſcoffers mocke and ieſt at the wordes of the Lorde, and make as great an account of preaching, as if it were an olde wiues tale tolde vnto them? In which their doing, beare they that reuerence vnto the worde of God which they ought? without all doubt, no. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, although there bée a great number of ſuche ſcoffers, as neither profite by the word of God, nor yet by his miracles, (as ſome ſuch there were in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of the Apoſtles) yet let vs not be any whit offended at them, but continue firme and conſtant, leaſt we fall into the like condemnation, for the contempt of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull works of God, &amp; for our not honouring of him as hée ought And this is a good obſeruation for vs in the firſt place. Now, S. Luke ſaith, that Peter in the behalfe of all the Apoſtles ſhewed that the ſcoffers and contemners of God were greatly ouerſhot, to ſcorne and ieſt at ſuch a myracle which they manifeſtly ſaw before their eies, and that they ought not to haue attributed it vnto any. ſuch drunkenneſſe, wherof they accuſed the Apoſtles. For, he ſaith, <hi>Yee men of Iewry, and all yee that dwell at Ieruſalem, bee this knowne vnto you, and heare my wordes: for theſe are not drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as yee ſuppoſe, ſeeing it is but the thirde houre of the day.</hi> We haue héere firſt of all to obſerue, that the men in olde time reckoned the houres otherwiſe then we doe: For they made the firſt houre to begin at the riſing of the Sun, and ſo they had alwaies twelue houres from the Sunne riſing vnto the going downe thereof, and as the daies grew lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger or ſhorter, euen ſo made they their houres. Moreouer, they deuided the day into four quarters, to wit, the firſt quarter beganne at the firſt houre, and continued vntill the third, the ſecond, from the thirde houre, vnto the ſixte, the thirde, from ſixe to nine, and the fourth, from nine vnto twelue. So that the
<pb facs="tcp:7663:186"/> ſixt houre was as it were, noone, and the third, was betwixt eight and nine in the morning as wée reckon.</p>
               <p>Let vs now come to the reaſon which S Peter brought, by which hée ſhewed that they were not drunke, as the Iewes thought. For, it is as much as if hée had ſaide, It is nowe about the thirde houre of the day, and that is (as I haue alredy ſaide) betwixt eight and nyne in the morning: and therfore it is not likely that men would bée drunke at that time of the day: and ſuch men eſpecially which gaue themſelues to ſerue God, And héerein Saint Peter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooueth drunkenneſſe, and ſheweth it to bée a very diſhoneſt thing for a man to be drunke in the morning. And yet wée ſhall finde a great many moe then néedeth, that are giuen to bée ſo drunkenne as that they haue neither wit, nor reaſon. And ſome of them will not bée drunke with that which they take in the morning, but will be ſo blockiſh with their wine which they gull in the euening, as that a man woulde thinke they had doone nothing els but bybbed from the péepe of the day. Another ſorte there are, who for feare they ſhould not haue drinke enough, will beginne ſo early, as that they will bée drunke all day long: and thereupon the wine ſo berea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them of their wit and vnderſtanding, as that they can neither goe nor ſtand. And therefore Saint Peter ſaith, That theſe men héere are not drunke: whereby he declareth that God is highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed therewith.</p>
               <p>Nowe, wée are in this place to note, that the Iewes ſo abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red drunkenneſſe, as that when any of them woulde fall to bee drunke, they woulde bée ſure to drinke drunke in the night, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were aſhamed that any other ſhould ſée the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And héerein we ſée that men were more ſhamefaſt at thoſe dayes then they are in theſe: becauſe at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time they loued to doe it in the night ſeaſon, &amp; now they make no reckoning to be drunk at noone dayes: and then forſooth, they muſt néedes haue a nap, &amp; ſo kéepe the liquor warme in the preſſe. And this we are ſure to ſée by them, that they will ſhew themſelues what they are euen at the ſermon time: For yée ſhall not ſee them ſcarſcely an houre at the hearing of the worde of God, but they will foorthwith manifeſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very effect of their drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe by their drowſines, ſo that they receiue no benefite in the whole worlde by comming thither. And no maruell: For the wine and the meate being not perfectly digeſted, by reaſon of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:7663:186"/> the ouer gorging of them ſelues, wherein they excéede the very bruite beaſtes, cauſeth them to be ſo heauie a ſléepe. Yea, and yée ſhall many times ſee them ſléepe at a Sermon in the morning, whenas a man would think they had neither eate nor drunke. But héerein they ſhewe what greate delight they haue in the woorde of God: and to this they can make no excuſe, becauſe they come pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently from their reſt. And now to the matter, S. Peter ſpeaketh according to the manner and cuſtome that then was, ſaying, It is not like that theſe men are drunken, ſince it is but the thirde houre of the day.</p>
               <p>Hee nowe heere applieth this myracle which was doone vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his doctrine. For, the holie Ghoſt was not geuen to the Apoſtles that they ſhould bée ſilent, whenas any thing were mooued which tended to the glorifiyng of the woorkes of GOD: but that they ſhoulde be ſtrong, conſtantly to deliuer out the woorde of God, and publiſhe the Goſpel accordingly as our Lorde Ieſus had graunted them the meane. And therefore wée ſée that God wrought wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and that the preaching of the Goſpel throughout the whole worlde by ſo ſmall a number, came not from men. Now, S. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in his Sermon ſheweth an holy boldneſſe of the ſpirite of God, and geueth them to vnderſtand, who made a mocke at the myracle that was done, and thought not reuerently of it, that Ieſus Chriſt manifeſteth not himſelfe vnto thoſe which ſcorne and ſcoffe at his woorkes.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, when hée ſayeth, <hi>And all yee that dwell at Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> Hée ſpeaketh vniuerſally to all men, and yet it appertayned not but vnto thoſe which made a ſcoffe at the myracle. For there were many at that time, who reuerently accompanied the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that greatly woondred at the matter.</p>
               <p>Why doeth S. Peter then attribute it to all thoſe that ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted thereat? Forſooth hée did it to this ende and purpoſe, that by the reproouing of this their faulte, hee meant too doe good too all the companie, and by that occaſion confirme ſo muche the rather the heartes of all ſuche as were abaſhed, and make them in an admiration and reuerence of the woorkes of GOD, by vtterlye refuſing the fooliſhe and fantaſticall opinion of all theſe, and ſuche like Gybers. And euen ſo woulde wée
<pb facs="tcp:7663:187"/> likewiſe at this day doe: For if there were any ſcoffers amongeſt vs, and that we meant to reprooue this fault, we would crie out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all, although the whole companie were not to bée charged therewith. And yet no doubt of it, all they whoſe conſciences were guilty, would ſurely condemne themſelues: for their owne wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe would ſufficiently witneſſe againſt them, without béeing charged therewith, or yet the matter by péecemeale layde open. Neuertheleſſe, it is méete that men ſometimes ſhoulde ſomewhat bée narrowly preſſed, and found fault with, as it were, by name, and to bée remembred, and poynted at with the finger for their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences: becauſe they woulde then, bée more aſhamed, then if they were generally reprooued.</p>
               <p>Howbeit it is a wonder to ſée, that ſome men can in no wiſe abide to be rebuked of their faultes, although it bee generally done: for thus they would couer it, why ſay they, although there are a great many guiltie of the vice which is ſpoken of, yet are there ſome, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent thereof. And ſo, we ſhall heare them murmure, ſaying, why crieth he out thus againſt al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? For, if ther be any ſuch, muſt hée therfore reproue al the reſt, and ſpeake it ſo generally. Thus wée ſée howe al of vs continually murmure againſt doctrine, and yet we ſée, that although there are but a very fewe which made a ieſt at this myracle here ſpoken of, yet S. Peter deliuereth his ſpéeche vnto all men, when he ſaieth, <hi>All yee that dwell in Hieruſalem,</hi> be this known vnto you that theſe are not drunke as yee thinke. And therfore when we ſée that S Peter ſpake after this maner, let not vs be wiſer then the holy Ghoſt, and when there ſhal bee a faulte which is not in all men, yet let not vs for al that ceaſe to tel al men of it, and although there may be ſome which are not guiltie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, yet let them by this example take héede they murmure not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they knowe themſelues to be voyde of ſuch a vice, and yet if they ſhould be more narrowly looked into (it may be) they woulde be found guiltie of a thouſand other as great. Let vs now ſee what Saint Peter meaneth by the making of this Sermon: Forſooth, his intent is, to bring the people to the knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt: and this was indeed the end why the tongues were geuen to the Apoſtles. For the diuerſitie of tongues did euen ſhut vp the gate againſt the Goſpel, ſo that without the knowledge of them, it ſeemed impoſſible to haue the Goſpel to bee preached throughout
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:7663:187"/> the worlde. And therefore Saint Peter ſaith, If yée remember the propheſie of the Prophet Ioel, the promiſe therein conteined, is accompliſhed by the comming of Ieſus Chriſte. For, after the threatnings of the Prophet, hée ſetteth downe this promiſe, <hi>That God woulde powre out his Spirite vpon all fleſhe.</hi> Wherein hée ſheweth, that when God will puniſhe the iniquitie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, it is not to make his choſen people diſpaire, but to confirme them by the exerciſe of the troubles in this world, which are rather laide vpon the choſen then vpon the reprobate.</p>
               <p>Wée ſée then, how y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our Lord is not ſo redy to powre out his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, but that he pardoneth al thoſe which haue recourſe vnto his goodneſſe and mercy. For hée is alwayes néere vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Pſal. 145.18.</note> which truly call vpon him. Now this hath continually béen the common vaine of the Prophetes, that when they woulde comfort poore ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, they would bring them to the knowledge of Ieſus Chriſte. And it was not without cauſe: for take vs from Ieſus Chriſt, and then, what ſhall wée finde in God? Surely we ſhall finde ſuche an excellencie and highneſſe in him, as ſhall throwe downe all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures into the bottomeles depth: becauſe that when we are come to the knowledge of our ſelues, wée ſhall finde nothing in vs, ſaue ſinne and iniquitie: to preſent our ſelues before the maieſtie of ſo great and mightie a Iudge, wée can by no meanes poſſible looke for any other thing, then the iuſtice and rigour of his vengeance, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for vs by reaſon of our iniquities. And I beſéeche you, which of vs in déed ſhall bée able to exempt him ſelf from out of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſinners, that hée may bée bolde to ſay, hée had not néede haue recourſe vnto the knowledge of Ieſus Chriſte? And yet wée ſée howe careleſſe wée are in this behalfe. In déede there is no man that will openly ſay, that he woulde not know Ieſus Chriſt: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit there are but a fewe which will trauell to ſéeke for him as hée ought to bée ſought for. And therefore it is no maruell though the Prophetes ſtoode alwaies vpon this point to bring vs to the knowledge of Ieſus Chriſte: for that is the only meane by which wée muſt bée reconciled vnto God, and wheron we muſt be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
               <p>Wée ſée then that when the holy Ghoſt came downe ſo abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it was to none other end, but that al ſuch as were eſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the knowledge of Ieſus Chriſte, might bee called and
<pb facs="tcp:7663:188"/> we al be brought together to be the people of God, &amp; ſo receiue him. But for the better vnderſtanding of this place, we muſt lay open the ſaying of the Prophet, <hi>It will come to paſſe</hi> (ſaith hée) <hi>in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dayes that I will powre my ſpirite vpon all fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſhe: and your ſonnes and daughters ſhall propheſie: and your young men ſhall ſee viſions, and your old men ſhall dreame dreames.</hi> Heerein is to bee obſerued, that although the Prophet ſaith that the holy ghoſte ſhall bée powred out vpon all fleſhe, yet that all men ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him: becauſe we ſée that a great many are bereaued thereof. Neuertheles, God calleth vs all, but we vnthankefully and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly withſtand him. And this is alwayes a true ſaying, That none commeth to him, but ſuch as the holy Ghoſt draweth. By this alſo wee are let to vnderſtande, that if wee come vnto Ieſus Chriſte by faith, and ſo, humbly holde vs there, we ſhal receiue the graces of the holy Ghoſte ſo abundantly, as that we may bee able to communicate them vnto our neighbours. And thus we ſee, that Ieſus Chriſte calleth vs all in generall: howbeit it is very farre of, that all doe come vnto him, becauſe we refuſe the benefit that is offered vs. And how ſo? Forſooth by reaſon we make our ſelues not worthie thereof, alwaies deſiring rather to giue our ſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our vanities, then vnto the feare of God.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, ſince it is ſo that many receiue not the graces which are offered them, although they are all called: heere might a queſtion be aſked, why the Prophet then ſpeaketh after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. In very deede, the Prophet his meaning is to vſe this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall kinde of ſpeech, to ſhew that God wil bring ſome of all eſtates and ages to knowe him: and alſo becauſe he maketh now no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the Iewe and the Gentile: For the power of the holy Ghoſte worketh euery where. We ſee that the people of the Iewes, were euen the very firſt amongſt all other nations, who knew the true God: and although the beléeuing Iewes were few in number, yet was the holy G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt offered vnto them all. In like caſe were the Gentiles alſo inſtructed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preaching of the Goſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l. Thus we ſée it to be no wonder in the ſaying of the Prophet, that God hath powred out his ſpirite vpon all fleſh.</p>
               <p>Nowe the doctrine which at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning was ſet foorth by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preaching of the Goſpell came firſt of all to the Iewes, to the ende
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:7663:188"/> that the ſaying of Ezechiel might be fulfilled, that from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of Hieruſalem, the riuers ſhould ouerflowe euen vnto the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt partes of the earth. Wherein, the meaning of the Prophet is, that the diuerſitie of tongues had neuer byn ſpread abroade, if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Ghoſt had not byn ſent vnto the Apoſtles, to haue diſperſed their doctrine throughout al the world. And therefore let vs right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, how God by his inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſible wiſedom hath woonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully wrought to haue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpel to be publiſhed: for although Ieſus Chriſt had very ſufficiently inſtructed the Apoſtles: yet were they but groſſe headed, vntill ſuch time as they had receiued the holye Ghoſt: But after they had receiued him, ſée howe they became of ſimple ſoules, ſuch great and learned Clarkes, as that they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the diuerſitie of tongues, the want of which (as I haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſaid) was an hinderance to the publiſhing of the Goſpel. And therefore, it was not without cauſe that the Prophete Ioel ſaide, that God had powred out his ſpirite, vpon al fleſh.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, wee are to obſerue héere in this place, this ſaying, <hi>That the olde men and young men ſhoulde propheſie.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee declareth that both olde and young ſhoulde bee partakers of the grace of the holie Ghoſt, And therefore, it is not now néedful for vs to ſéeke for any gloſe, to vnderſtand the meaning of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in this ſpéech, All fleſhe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe the very Texte, ſufficiently ſheweth his meaning. Nowe, when hée ſaieth, That the young men ſhould propheſie, Hée ſpake then according to the manner of the time in thoſe dayes: becauſe GOD vſed theſe two kindes of meanes with his ſeruantes, either in viſion, or els in dreame, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which is ſet downe in the booke of Numbers,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Num.</hi> 12.6.</note> that God would ſhew himſelf vnto his Prophets by viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; ſpeake vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to them in dreames: But it is ſaid, that he would ſpeake with his ſeruant Moſes, mouth to mouth. Howbeit it might bee alleadged, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the doctrine of the law &amp; the doctrine of the Goſpel is not like: &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> although God manifeſted himſelfe vnto the Prophetes in the olde Teſtament, yet will hée not ſhewe himſelfe vnto vs after that ſort. To anſwere this, it is to bée conſidered, that although the prophet vſeth theſe tearmes, yet doeth he it, only to fit himſelf vnto the time wherin he was, becauſe we ſhuld not ſay, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue a greater meaſure of knowledge. For to ſay truely, GOD neuer ſhewed
<pb facs="tcp:7663:189"/> himſelfe ſo manifeſtly in the olde Teſtament, as hée hath nowe doone to vs by Ieſus Chriſte. For where God had appointed the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to bée ſacrificed in the old Lawe, which were but figures and ſhadowes to bée oftentimes vſed, that it might bée ſéene that men could not come néere vnto God, but by the meane of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: wée haue at this preſent the perſonall preſence of the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor himſelf, who once for all hath fulfilled euery thing, by his alone Sacrifice. And therefore there is nowe no Sacrifice to bée doone for the purging and ſanctifiyng of ſinnes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mala.</hi> 1.11</note> but onely the Sacrifice of thankeſgiuing vnto our GOD: who therewith is well pleaſed through our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. And although it is ſaid in the Scripture, that at the comming of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, Altars ſhoulde bée ſet vp throughout the whole worlde, to Sacrifice vnto the Lorde our God, yet muſt wée leaue the figure, and reſt in the trueth. For, inaſmuch as the Altar was a ſigne of the worſhip of God, becauſe it is ſaide that Sacrifice ſhould bée doone all the worlde through, the meaning is, that God ſhoulde vniuerſally bee worſhipped. No doubt of it, the Pope, with all his Colledge of Cardinalls, and all other his deare friendes the Romaniſtes, wyll conclude vppon this place, that there muſt néedes bée Sacrifices had. And therefore, when they woulde haue their Maſſe allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they bring in this teſtimony of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scripture. Howbeit if it were ſo, as they make themſelues beléeue, Surely, ſurely they muſte néedes conclude that Ieſus Chriſte hath not yet appeared, nor that his kingdome is yet come. Neuertheleſſe, wée ſée the contrary. And therefore, ſéeing the Prophets haue thus ſaid, it is not only to ſhew that God ſhould be vniuerſally worſhipped in ſpirite &amp; trueth, and not in figures:</p>
               <p>Moreouer, héere is to bée noted, that the ſaying of Propheſie, is not meant by the Prophet, to tell of things to come, as in the olde time it was taken: but the meaning is, that whoſoeuer ſhal haue the gift of Propheſie, ſhoulde bée able to teache and apply doctrine, to the ende wee might bée brought to the knowledge of the trueth and profite therby, And ſo, the promiſe that was made vnto vs of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Ieſus Chriſt, conteyneth thus much y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we ſhould be more déeply ſéene in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly things, then heretofore we haue béen. For we ſée in very déede y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> S. Paul calleth it the wiſdome of God:<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Cor. 2.</note>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:7663:189"/> vnder which all things ſhould be ſubiect. Wée are nowe therefore, briefly to conclude vpon all things: That as our Lord in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ieſus Chriſte his ſonne into the worlde, to make vnto vs a more liuely aſſurance of our ſaluation: Euen ſo, by ſending vnto vs his holy ſpirite, hée hath made vs greater partakers of his graces, then euer hée did before. The Prophet Ioel ſoone after ſetteth downe in this place, <hi>That God will doe wonderful things in heauen aboue, and ſignes in the earth belowe, blood, fire, and vapour of ſmoke: that the Sunne ſhall bee turned into darkenes, and the Moone into blood.</hi> Theſe wordes ſhewe, that greate and maruellous things muſt come to paſſe, whenas Ieſus Chriſt ſhall manifeſt himſelfe. And why ſo? Forſooth, becauſe the the worlde ſhall then bée changed. For they which woulde fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe Ieſus Chriſte, muſt wholy alter their nature. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the comming of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte called the latter dayes.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, this is not ſpoken for a day, or for a moneth: But the Prophet referreth all that is héere ſpoken, vnto the whole time fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the comming of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, vntill the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſo that wée muſt incloſe the wonders which ſhall bée doone at the comming of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, from the time of his comming, vnto the laſt day. And to ſay truely, the forwarder wee goe, the greater thinges will hée doe, as wee dayly finde by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Nowe, that we vnderſtand the meaning of the Prophete, let vs apply the ſame to our owne vſe. For where it is ſaid in the firſt place, that God will powre out his ſpirite vpon all fleſh, we are to conſider, that the greateſt benefite which we can poſſibly haue, is to bée partakers of the graces of his holy ſpirite. And this is the moſt excellent gift which God beſtoweth vpon vs, in reſpect wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, all the worldly liberalitie which he rendreth vnto vs is nothing For, whenſoeuer wée are bereaued of this gift, Ieſus Chriſte is taken from vs, and vntill ſuche time as wée are clothed with him, all whatſoeuer wée doe, tendeth to our condemnation. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, God ſaith, that we cannot be his children, without wee bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deawed and ſprinkled with his holy ſpirite.</p>
               <p>Nowe, if wee bée not his children, wée ſhall neuer be partakers in the communitie of Ieſus Chriſte. For although God offereth vnto vs his graces, yet is Ieſus Chriſt nothing vnto vs vntill ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:7663:190"/> time as wée haue receiued the holy Ghoſte. Let vs then conclude héereupon, that vnto the time that wee are partakers of the holy Ghoſt, wée are reprobate, and the children of perdition: becauſe it is hée which ſanctifieth and maketh vs holy in the ſight of God. So then, vntil ſuch time we be as called by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledg of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (which wée can no way haue, but by the gift of the holy ghoſt) to lift vp our mindes on high, wée are faſt tyed to the earth, as if it were in Hell. And héereupon it is that Saint Paule ſpeaketh, when he ſaith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14.</note> That they which haue receiued the holy Ghoſt, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themſelues according to the will of God declared in his word are I ſay, the children of God: and they, without all doubt are the children of the Diuell, who following their carnall affections giue themſelues ouer to their pleaſure and delight. Thus we ſée how neceſſary a thing it is for all thoſe that would bee acccounted the children of GOD, to haue the knowledge of Gods trueth.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, wée cannot excuſe our ſelues, if wée receiue not his graces: becauſe hée offereth them vnto al: but wée are ſo accurſed as that we forſake the benefite which hée would beſtowe vpon vs. And héerein is knowne the goodneſſe of God to vs warde, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wée ſtriue alwaies againſt his will, yet ceaſeth hée not for all that, to offer himſelfe vnto all: as it is héere ſaid by the Prophet <hi>That young, and olde,</hi> men and women, ſhal all receiue of one and the ſelfe ſame ſpirite. And it is to this end, that no man might bée able truely ſay, O Sir, I am vtterly vnlearned: and therefore it is impoſſible for one to vnderſtand the Scriptures, whereby I might receiue the holy ghoſt. Why, I beſéech you, hath God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed vnto the learned alone, the grace of his holy ſpirite, &amp; to none other? Nowe, ſurely this is a very ſtrange kinde of excuſe. And therefore, when wée ſée that God ſo liberally dealeth, as that hée will neither exclude age nor ſexe from receiuing of the holy ghoſte, are not wée very accurſed to withdraw ourſelues from him, when as hée is deſirous to come néere vs? And to ſay the truth, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie that is héere ſpoken of, is to be accompliſhed at the comming of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. Wherfore ſince he at this day hath all power and dominion, it muſt néedes bée manifeſted, &amp; wée muſt alſo vnderſtand, that the thing which was foretolde, is moſt true. And therfore ſince the thing that was ſpoken of, hath ſo manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared, curſed are we, if wée doe not our beſt to walke in the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:7663:190"/> feare of the Lorde, and receiue the graces whiche hee offereth vs. Wée haue alredye ſaide, that hée taketh exceptions too none: Howbeit wée are ſo wicked, as that wée cannot take in good part the thing offered vnto vs. What is the cauſe thereof? ſurely, ſurely, our infidelitie. Wherefore neither young nor old can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelues of this fault, in not ſubmitting themſelues vnto the obedience of God, ſéeing hée hath called all thereto. Neither is it to be wondered at, although they ſo little profit in this doctrine For if we marke it, the elder ſort will growe ſo obſtinate, and ouer growne in wickedneſſe, as that no exhortation will doe them good. And the younger ſort are as diſſolute as Diuels: For if they bée exhorted, they waxe ſo madde as that to any mans thinking they would tread vnder foote, both God, and his worde, and as many as deliuer it.</p>
               <p>Now, Ieſus Chriſte, who is the wiſedome, mildeneſſe, and méekeneſſe of the Father, wyl haue nothing to doe with ſuch foxes and Lions. And if they be told, that they muſt humble themſelues vnder the mightie hand of God, to the ende they might vnderſtand that they haue a Father in heauen, who will not care onely for their bodily nurriture, but will alſo entertaine and gouerne them by his holy ſpirite, they paſſe not an hawe of al this, but take leaue to doe what wickedneſſe ſoeuer they luſt.</p>
               <p>Now, becauſe the time will not ſerue, to procéede any further héerein, we will reſerue the handeling of the reſidue vntil Sunday next. And ſith we cannot be acceptable in the ſight of the Lord our God, but by the meane of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, let vs fall downe before his maieſtie in his name, and beſéech him ſo to inſtruct vs by his holy ſpirite, as that wée may vnderſtande that the Prophetes ſpake by him for our inſtruction, and that we alſo might learne to benefite our ſelues, ſo that it might turne to the glory and praiſe of his holy name, and the edifying of our neighbours. And ſo let vs moſt humbly ſay, O Almighty God and heauenly father. &amp;c.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>PON Sunday laſt paſt, we declared vnto you, howe that at the comming of Ieſus Chriſte, God ſo powred out his great treaſures in the worlde, as that both men &amp; women, young and olde, were partakers of his grace. Now, the riches which the Lord God of his bountifull goodneſſe ſo liberally beſtowed, were no earthly riches, which could periſh &amp; come to naught. But euen the holy Ghoſte himſelfe, from whom commeth all the riches and treaſure of ſaluation. And beſides, wée haue ſhewed that God hath not doone it only for a time, but is alſo redy to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the ſame which hée hath ſpoken: yea and at this day he inri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs with his graces if the fault be not ours. But wee bée ſo accurſed, as that wée are voyd of them by reaſon of our vnthanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe: For his liberalitie, is as great at this day as euer it was in the time of the Apoſtles (whenas hée ſent downe vnto them
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:7663:191"/> the holie Ghoſt) euen to make vs partakers of the ſelf ſame grace, which hée liberally beſtowed vpon them: howbeit, wée are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous and faythleſſe, as that we ſtoppe that way vpon him, by which he would come vnto vs. For when hée calleth vs by his worde, to make vs partakers of his holie ſpirite, wée drawe arſewarde: ſo that a man would thinke, wée had conſpired to ſet our ſelues againſt him. And where, both olde, and young, men, and women, are called to be partakers of this grace, and ought to endeuour them ſelues by all meanes poſſible to receiue the holie Ghoſt, and more and more to perſeuere and continue in receiuing of the ſame, we ſée the elder ſort to be more hard hearted and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate then the reſt: and the younger people to be giuen ouer to all kinde of lewdneſſe: ſo that, if they, be tolde of their diſſoluteneſſe, they wax ſo madde and furious, as that it ſhould ſéeme they would marre all. And when men ſhould be manlyke, and ſharpe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to giue diligent héede vnto the word of God, they are become as blockiſh as bruit beaſtes. And where the women alſo ſhoulde be humble, and walke ſoberly, and honeſtly, they are extreame diſſolute, and too too gallaunt, and full of all ſuperfluous vaine vanities.</p>
               <p>And therefore, if nowe we ſée not men enioy the graces of the holie Ghoſt, which God here ſpeaketh of, that hée will poure out vpon his ſeruantes, and handmaydes, it is not becauſe hée hath chaunged any whit his determination and purpoſe, but by reaſon we will not ſuffer him to do vs good: For, when he commeth neare vs, we drawe backward. Wherefore, hée is not the let, why we doe not all receiue his graces. For, the Prophet ſaieth (as wée haue heretofore ſaide) <hi>That God will poure out his holie ſpirite vpon all fleſh.</hi> Hée namely ſayeth, vpon all fleſh, which is, vpon all people without exception.</p>
               <p>True it is, that Ieſus Chriſt was ſent vnto the Iewes, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to pull them from out of the bondage of the Deuill, but to make them partakers alſo of the giftes of the holie Ghoſt. Howbeit, wée are at this preſent, gathered altogether into one Church, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there remaineth nothing but to ſhewe the effect of our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie, and of the graces which God hath beſtowed on vs: and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> let vs not doubt, but that we ſhall receiue the giftes of the holie Ghoſt, ſince it is ſaide, that God hath not poured them out vpon
<pb facs="tcp:7663:192"/> one or two, but generally vpon all men. Wherefore, it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for vs to boaſt that we are Chriſtians, without we ſhew the effect thereof, that it may be knowne, that we vainly take not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs this name of Chriſtianitie. For, we muſt not doe as many of the Papiſts doe, who neither care for God nor his worde, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent them ſelues onely with this bare name of a Chriſtian: and ſo they may be called by that name, they care for no more. Nowe, if they be aſked, and if they be Chriſtians, I pray you, what anſwer will they make? Surely, they think they haue great wrong offred them, to haue this queſtion demaunded. What? I beſéech you good Syr, will they ſay, are we not Chriſtians, haue we not béene bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized? Yea ywis, I graunt it: But what faith haue you for all this? Verely, they will ſay, that they beléeue as the Church beléeueth. And ſo by this meane they haue aſwadled fayth, wherin their tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers haue inſtructed them, in ſaying, That it is ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for them to beléeue as the Church beléeueth. Let them alſo be aſked, how God is to be ſerued and worſhipped, why, they thinke that queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſoone anſwered. And thus doeth God iuſtly puniſh the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie of men, when we ſée ſimple ſoules guided by ſuch inſtructers of Satan, to bring them tumbling headlonges together into the bottomleſſe pyt of hell with them ſelues. Thus we ſée howe this Romiſh Idoll hath licoured Chriſtendome with all kinde of lying, and falſe doctrine. And howe ſo? Forſooth, becauſe men haue ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vp the way againſt the word of God, and are contented to be lycoured, with leaſing. But by the way, let vs come home to our ſelues, and let vs neither condemne the Papiſtes, nor yet any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but eftſoones apply this doctrine vnto our owne vſe. Firſt of all, we haue the Goſpell, the doctrine of all wiſedome, and yet how deafe and blockiſh are wée? we are daily preached vnto: But what inſtruction receiue we thereby for all that? Surely, ſurely, it is wel enough perceiued, and the fruit that commeth by it. Without all doubt, it is truely ſayde, That wée haue the Goſpell: But if we liue not in all obedience therevnto, what teſtimony ſhall wée haue, that wée are the ſeruants of God. For (according to that which wée handled on Sunday laſt) we cannot be the ſeruants of God, without wee be partakers of his holie ſpirite, who is not without cauſe called the ſpirite of wiſedome: For, by this we are ſhewed, that we cannot haue ſo ſmall a portion of the holy Ghoſt,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:7663:192"/> if we will continue it, but that God wil more and more augment it in vs. In verie déede, euerie man cannot haue the lyke mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thereof: howbeit, that is no let why we ſhoulde not encreaſe our ſmall Talent. For although a man hath the gift of tongues, yet may he not haue one ſome grace which an other man hath? And héerevpon is that ſaying of Saint Paule verefied,<note place="margin">Rom. <hi>12.</hi>3. Epheſ. 4.7.</note> That God will giue of his graces to euerie man according to ſuch meaſure as wée are the members of Ieſus Chriſt. As we ſée, that the members of one bodie, haue not all one office: For the féete will doe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which the handes cannot doe: the eyes are put to an other maner of vſe then the eares are: and ſo conſequently, are all the parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. Euen ſo, our Lord will beſtow his holie ſpirite vpon ſome, after an other ſort, then hée will vpon other ſome: and yet it is all one and the ſelfe ſame ſpirit, and therfore if we would be knowne to be Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, we muſt haue the knowledge of that which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of: and that it is God which guideth vs by his holie ſpirite, to the ende we ſhould not be like vnto thoſe blinde ones which walke in infidelitie. And thus much for this ſaying, That God wil poure out of his holie ſpirite vpon all fleſh.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, where it is ſaide, <hi>That they ſhall propheſie,</hi> herein the meaning of the Prophet is to ſignifie vnto vs, That when God will inſtruct vs, hée will doe it ſo perfectly, as that the doctrine ſhall not onely profite our ſelues, but that we ſhall alſo be able to teach others. And in déede, whoſoeuer ſhall receiue greater gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from God then the reſt, is ſo much the more bounde to inſtruct the baſe and ſimple ones, and giue him ſelfe to teach his neighbors. Wherefore, let vs vnderſtande, that after God hath inſtructed vs, that it is our duetie to labour to bring others vnto the knowledge of him. And hereupon it is that Iſaiah ſpeaketh, ſaying,<note place="margin">Iſaiah. 2.2. Mich. <hi>4.1.</hi>
                  </note> Let euerie man take his neighbour by the hand, and lead him vp vnto the holy hill. And this is one of the moſt principall pointes, whereby God alloweth our Chriſtianitie, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we ſo loue our neighbours, as to inſtruct them in the word of God. Now, this is done by the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which we haue receiued of him at the handes of the Apoſtles, which came out (as we ſaid laſt Sunday) of the fountaine of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, whoſe riuers ſo ouerflowed the whole world, as that euery man might not onely receiue it for his owne behoofe, but alſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute it vnto our neighbours.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7663:193"/>
               <p>In déed, all men are not Doctors to teach: howbeit if we be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, we haue ſufficient wherewith to exhort our neighbours. Let vs now come to the other part of the propheſie of the Prophet Ioell, where it is ſaide,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That God will ſend terrible and wonderous ſignes, blood, and fyre, and the vapoure of ſmoke. The Sunne ſhall be turned into darkneſſe, and the Moone into blood.</hi> Wherein (as wée haue briefly ſaide) the Prophet meant to ſhewe, that when God would viſite his people at the comming of Ieſus Chriſt, although great felicitie and bleſſing was promiſed, yet the meaning was not for all that, but that we ſhould ſée horrible and merueylous thinges. And therefore it was verie néedfull that we ſhould be told of it, to the ende we might vnderſtande, that the comming of Ieſus Chriſt was not to place vs in this world as in a Paradiſe, and to liue in it at our eaſe and pleaſure: But that Ieſus Chriſt was ſent to an other ende: to wit, that wee might be drawne from theſe earthly things, and be lifted vp vnto heauenly matters. And to ſay true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there were neuer ſo horrible and wonderfull thinges, as were at the comming of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Nowe, if it be aſked why ſuch thinges came to paſſe, after that Ieſus Chriſt was manifeſted: it is becauſe we were ſo curſed, as that we would not receiue the graces which hée would haue beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed vpon vs. And therefore, when our Lorde offreth him ſelfe vnto vs, and we refuſe him, muſt hée not then of neceſſitie ſo lift vp his hande, as to thunder and ſtorme, that we might be afearde of that our ſo great vnthankfulneſſe. We ſée therefore why it is ſaide, that when God had poured out his holie ſpirit, that we muſt néedes ſée wonderfull troubles, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue looked vnto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen aboue, and vpon the earth beneath, we ſhall ſée in them both, ſuch great trouble and feare, as that a man woulde think heauen and earth ſhould euen goe together: ſo that the Sunne ſhoulde bée darkened, the Moone be turned to blood, the Starres fall from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and other wonderfull ſignes appeare. In verie déede, there are ſome which reſtraine this vnto the latter day: howbeit, the Prophet meaneth to ſpeake of all the reigne and dominion of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, vntill his comming at the laſt day to iudge the world. And therefore we muſt apply all the ſignes whereof the Prophet here ſpeaketh, vnto our time. For if we conſidered of the thinges
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:7663:193"/> which are come to paſſe, euen ſince the Goſpell hath béen preached in theſe dayes, yet could not be poſſible but that the verie thinking of them would make the haires of our head ſtand vpright. Surely, if we had ſéene the thinges that were done at the comming of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, we ſhould haue been verie blockiſh if wée had not been afeard: For if we did but rightly conſider of the thinges that are continually done euen at this day, we ſhould haue matter enough to wonder at.</p>
               <p>And therefore it was not the meaning of the Prophet, to ſignifie for a ſeaſon, the ſignes that ſhould here appeare at the comming of Ieſus Chriſt: For, although at his comming, hée poured out his great treaſures, to diſperſe them abroad vpon all men, yet for all that we ſhall ſée merueylous iudgements, by reaſon of the vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of men, who will not receiue the thing that is offred them. And to the ſelfe ſame purpoſe ſerueth that ſaying of Ieſus Chriſt, when hée ſpake of the deſtruction of the Temple. For marke,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.3.</note> the Diſciples aſked him, when all theſe thinges ſhould come to paſſe, and what ſigne there ſhould be of his comming, &amp; of the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the worlde: for they thought as fondly as the Iewes, that the Temple ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue euen vnto conſummatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world, and that they in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mean while ſhould reigne peaceably like earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Princes. Thus we ſée what the queſtion was that they aſked, notwithſtanding, that Ieſus Chriſt had no ſpéech of the laſt day. Now, hée anſwered them thus, you ſhall ſée (ſaieth hée) meruey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous terrible thinges: For, you make this reckoning, that yée ſhal dwell héere on earth peaceably, and rule at your pleaſure: howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it yée ſhall finde it cleane contrarie, becauſe there will ſodeinely come deceiuers: and beſides, the Deuil will do all hée can, to ſpread falſe doctrine in euerie place: There ſhal be peſtilence, warres, and famine, ſo that a man would thinke that the world ſhould be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpſide downe. And when you ſhall ſée all theſe thinges, yet is not the ende come: For, Ieruſalem ſhall be deſtroyed. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hée ſheweth, that it is ſo farre of, that the Iewes ſhould haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny peaceable life here in this world, as that it cannot be choſen but that they muſt féele the iudgementes of God come vpon them for their vnthankfulneſſe: which ſhal ſoone after be diſperſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the face of the whole world. And conſequently, hée goeth on and ſaieth, That after the troubles in thoſe dayes, The Sunne
<pb facs="tcp:7663:194"/> ſhould be darkened, and the Moone loſe her light, that the Starres ſhould fall from heauen, and all the powers of the heauens be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Which wordes agrée iuſt with the ſaying of the Prophet: as if hée ſhould haue ſaid, That great troubles ſhall not onely be ſéene here below, but alſo, if a man did looke vp vnto heauen, hée ſhould ſée a generall confuſion. And yet muſt we not for all that but come fort our ſelues: For although we ſée both in heauen and earth, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny troubles, and breaches, ſo that if we went all the world ouer, we ſhould ſée nothing els but all accurſed, yet muſt we take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight in the maker of all theſe thinges. This then is the ſumme and effect of the meaning of the Prophet. And this is at this preſent ſpoken euen vnto vs: For although God viſiteth vs, and beſtoweth his Goſpell vpon vs, yet doeth hée not it to this end that we ſhould in ſuch ſort liue heere, as it pleaſeth our ſelues, in all eaſe and delight, and be voyde of warre, famine, and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: But wée are aduiſedly to conſider, that when ſuch thinges come to paſſe, and that we ſée ſo great and generall a confuſion, ſo that we cannot tell which way to turne vs: wee muſt euen then, I ſay, prepare our heartes, paciently to abide thoſe afflictions, and not thinke them ſtraunge: becauſe they light vpon vs for our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe. For, the meaning of our good God is, to ſhew him ſelfe a gentle and louing Father: and if we paciently ſuffer theſe thinges at his handes, it will appeare, that hée calleth not vs his good Sonnes for nothing: But if we be ſo rude and vnmannerlie, as that we will not take, and acknowledge him for our Father, is it not méete that hée ſhould correct vs for ſuch a contempt. For, let vs vnderſtande, that hée hath as great authoritie ouer vs, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny father hath ouer his childe. Howbeit, he is a Father for euer: and therefore, when as hée afflicteth vs (be it neuer ſo gréeuouſly) yet muſt we not diſpaire for all that: But wée muſt vnderſtande that hée doeth it becauſe we are vnthankfull.</p>
               <p>Wée ſee then in ſumme, howe we are to conſider, of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of God, and that whatſoeuer the Prophets haue foretold, is fulfilled euen before our faces. And nowe, let vs come vnto the comfort which the Prophet ſetteth downe herevpon: which is, <hi>That whoſoeuer calleth vpon the name of God, ſhall bee ſaued.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:7663:194"/>
               <p>If hée had ſaide no more, but that which went before, wée might then in déede, haue béene meruellouſly aſtoniſhed: becauſe, it were altogether to diſcomfort vs: but hée ſetteth downe eftſoones a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort withall, That if we call vpon the name of God, we ſhall bée ſaued, euen amiddeſt the greateſt troubles and diſſentions that may bée: yea, for although hell were readie to ſwallow vs vp, yet haue wée this aſſured refuge, that if we truſt in our God and call vpon him, wée are out of doubt to be ſaued. When any man is gréeued and troubled, then this is the comming of Satan, to make him diſtruſt, to the ende hée might not come vnto God, and call vpon him. Howbéeit héere is a great comforte which wée ought to laye holde on, to the contrarie, in that God appointeth vs no ſet time to call vpon him: ſo that whenſoeuer wée are caſt downe, as it were, into the bottomleſſe pyt of hell, yet may we euen then call boldly vpon him. For, as the Propet ſayeth, That hée which ſhal call vpon the name of God, ſhall be ſaued: euen ſo contrariwiſe, he that calleth not vpon him ſhal be damned: yea, although he were as in a Paradiſe. For, if the verie Angelles did not call on him, God might reiect them: which is impoſſible to be done. Nowe, we may hereby ſée, that it is impoſſible for vs to continue here in this world, one minute of an houre, without we did call vpon the name of God.</p>
               <p>And therefore, we ought to call this leſſon oftentimes to mynde: For the Prophet pronounceth iudgement againſt all thoſe which call not vpon the name of God, in ſaying, That whoſoeuer calleth vpon the name of God, ſhall be ſaued: and thereupon neceſſarily enſueth, That hée which calleth not vpon him, ſhall be damned. And forſomuch as we are ſo colde and ſo eaſily withdrawne from the calling vpon the name of God, The Prophet (by the ſaying going before) his meaning was to declare, that we muſt not leaue of calling vpon his Maieſtie, no not when we are in the mydſt of all the greateſt troubles which may come vnto vs: For, although heauen and earth ſhould conſpire againſt vs, yet muſt we euen then call vpon the Maieſtie of our God, both with heart &amp; mouth, and with all power and ſtrength. Howbeit, it is not enough that we ſay with open mouth, <hi>a Pater noſter,</hi> in Latin, or els, Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which art in heauen in our mother tongue, except it bée
<pb facs="tcp:7663:195"/> ſaide with the right affection of the heart grounded vpon faith. For otherwiſe, we may ſay ouer this prayer, tenne, twentie, and thir<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie times: and yet they ſhall be but wordes wherewith to beat the ayre. I will not ſpeake of the entermedling of the <hi>Aue Maria</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt, thinking by ſuch ſilly gawdes, that they truely call vpon the name of God as hée requireth. For ſurely, ſuch kinde of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are farre from the true calling vpon the name of God: but are euen like Witches, and Sorcerers, who can not forget their olde Deuiliſh ſuperſtitions. And therefore we muſt not meruayle ouermuch at ſuch relikes of Satan:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14.</note> becauſe they neuer had, nor yet haue, any fayth in Ieſus Chriſt. For how ſhall they (as Saint Paule ſaieth) call vpon him whom they haue not beléeued? And this place is worthie the noting: Becauſe Saint Paule telleth vs, that when the calling vpon the name of God is ſpoken of, that wée muſt ſéeke after him as after our Father: ſince we knowe that all the benefites which we haue come from him, and that hée is redie to receiue vs, ſo ſoone as we turne vnto him. For els, what cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage might we haue to craue any thing at his handes, if wee were not ſure of this? And therefore, let vs be fully perſuaded, that when we in trueth, call vpon the Lorde our God, that hée will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs.</p>
               <p>Wée ſée then by this, what a fantaſticall imagination the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſticall fondlinges haue. For, thus they ſay, That we muſt in no wiſe preſume that God will heare vs when we call vpon him: and their reaſon forſooth is this, forſomuch as we knowe not whether we be in the ſtate of grace or not: For this, ſay they, were too too great preſumption to thinke. Why, what is then to be done? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, They tell vs that we muſt pray doubtfully: and that it is ſufficient, if wée remit all to their mother holy Church: to wyt, that wée muſt haue this anſwere alwayes readie in our mouthes, I beléeue as the holie Church beléeueth. Thus we ſée howe, that they would haue our fayth to be doubtfull and vncertaine. Now, Saint Paule telleth vs, that God lyketh not of this geare: For, hée ſayeth, That the Goſpell is not preached vnto vs, to make vs ſtande in doubt, but to aſſure vs of our ſaluation. And therefore we may eaſily iudge what Popiſh fayth is, wherein we were nuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the time of ignoraunce.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, let vs vnderſtande, that God hath beſtowed a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:7663:195"/> grace vpon vs, in pulling vs out of that darkneſſe of errour and ſuperſtition wherein we were, and hath giuen vs his Goſpell to bring vs into the way of ſaluation. When we then ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of all theſe thinges, we ought to ſigh and grone, ſéeing that God of his great goodneſſe, hath choſen vs amongſt all the reſt of the nations, to beſtow the knowledge of his moſt holy and bleſſed worde. Now, this is the miſchiefe that is in Popery (as hath béen alredie ſaide) when as they ſay that we may not in full aſſuraunce call vpon God, for that, ſay they, is preſumption, and therefore that hée is to be called vpon, doubtfully. Neither are they the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler and common ſort of people which doe mainteine this: But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the greateſt and chiefeſt Doctours, and ſuch as are thought to haue all the holie ſcriptures imprinted in their heartes. In déede they will not be ouer earneſt, in defending of their Mawmets: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, to ſay truely, they take verie great paine to maintein them: But when any occaſion is giuen vnto them, to vomyt out theyr blaſphemies, they will be ſo ſtout, as that a man woulde thinke they were Bedlem lyke. And why ſo? Forſooth, becauſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill woulde haue them hinder vs, from calling of the name of God as we ſhould. Euen ſo then, as many as pray vnto God as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes doe, let them be aſſured, that God miſliketh of them. For (as hath alredie béen ſaide) we muſt not pray vnto God after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as to ſay, repeate, and oftentymes mumble vp, the Lordes prayer. Becauſe all they that ſo doe, are no better then Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and Witches. It is true in déede that we ſhoulde not, from the heart, make ouer long prayers: For when we doe pray, wée ſhould forſake our ſelues, and forget our owne nature, the Deuil, and all his entiſementes, to the ende wée might the more readelier come vnto our Lorde God. And after this ſort it is that we muſt deale.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, let vs be well aſſured of this, that if we knowe not rightly to call vpon the name of God, we haue nothing. Let vs therefore throughly conſider of this ſaying, That we are all dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as many as call not vpon God. For, it is written in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, ſpeaking of the curſed lyne of Cayne,<note place="margin">Gene. 4.26.</note> That they builded them ſelues houſes, &amp; ſtrong Towers, and yet for all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they had not the true calling vpon the name of God: But, it is ſaide, That after A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam had begotten Seth, that the name of God was a freſh called
<pb facs="tcp:7663:196"/> vpon. And therefore, God at that time was worſhipped and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: For after that Seth, had béen once taught the worſhip of God, hée himſelf alſo ſoone after taught his children to doe the like. Now, we ſée, that about the worſhip of God it is onely ſaide, That the name of God was called vpon. This then is the moſt principall pointe that we ought to holde. For, although this name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, flyeth about amongſt vs, yet doe we but abuſe it, if wée call not vpon the name of God. Neither can we (as Saint Paul ſaith, and as it hath béen héeretofore touched) call vpon him without wée haue firſt, beléeued in him.</p>
               <p>In verie déede, the farther from blowes, the bolder we are. For we ſhall ſée a number of Scoffers (when they are vpon their Ale Bench) that will be then, as good Chriſtians as any in the world: and a man would thinke them to be the true Champions of Ieſus Chriſt, and had gotten at his handes whatſoeuer was poſſible to be had of him. And beſides, ſome of them would promiſe to worke wonders, whenſoeuer the time ſhould come: and (to heare them ſpeake) a man would ſuppoſe, that if Chriſtianitie were vtterly loſt, it ſhould be founde in them: But if they be narrowly ſifted, and the bottome of their heartes ſearched, we ſhall finde nothing leſſe in them, then that they promiſed, and would be the firſt that would forſake God. And why ſo? Forſooth, becauſe they haue not this conſideration with them ſelues, to thinke what they are: For, whenſoeuer euerie man ſhall looke well vnto him ſelfe, hée ſhall finde a ſea of ſinnes, whereof hée can no way be ryd, without by ſighing and groning we runne vnto God, and call vpon him in our neceſſitie.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, we are to vnderſtand, that the Sermon, which S. Peter made in the Citie of Ieruſalem, is at this preſent made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, to the end we might profite our ſelues thereby: and let vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo note, that hée brought not in the place of the Prophet Ioell for naught. And therefore, let vs be ſure to truſt vnto this promiſe, That whoſoeuer calleth vpon the name of God, ſhall be ſaued.</p>
               <p>And according to this holie doctrine, Let vs fall downe before the Maieſtie of our good God, and acknowledge our offences, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſéeching him ſo to bleſſe vs with his grace, as that we may ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently call vpon him, as that our prayers may be acceptable in his ſight, ſo that wée, being deliuered from all ſuperſtition and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:7663:196"/> idolatrie, might truely worſhip him, to the ende wee might take him for our Father and Sauiour, and he likewiſe at laſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge vs for his children. And ſo let vs all ſay, O Almightie God, and heauenly Father, &amp;c.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that Saint Peter had in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon declared, that the promiſe contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Propheſie of the Prophete Ioel was accompliſhed, by the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending of the holie Ghoſt vpon him, and vpon his companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s the Apoſtles, for a teſtimony, and as a pledge which the Lord God meant to communicate vnto his Church, and vnto euery faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full member therof: and yet that there muſt néedes fall out great troubles, and that the fayth of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians might be proued and tried: After all theſe thinges, I ſay, hée bringeth the Iewes to Ieſus Chriſt. For fith the holy Ghoſt was giuen, they could not chooſe but acknowledge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> comming of Ieſus
<pb facs="tcp:7663:197"/> Chriſt: Becauſe it was ſaide, That the Propheſie of Ioel ſhould not be accompliſhed vntill the latter dayes. And therefore, when as we ſée the holie Ghoſt thus poured out, it is a ſure token that God hath ſent Ieſus Chriſt, to the ende hée might make an ende of our ſaluation. Now, this is an excellent maner, and a verie conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent order of teaching, which we are here to note, to wit, That, looke how many graces of his holy ſpirit, God giueth vs, are euen ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meanes to bring and guide vs to Ieſus Chriſt, whereby wée might learne all wiſedome of him: For he is the verie fountayne, out of whom we muſt all drawe the ſame. And to ſay truely, Firſt of all, forſomuch as he was the worde of God from the beginning, hée is alſo the life and light of men. And becauſe hee hath receyued moſt perfectly,<note place="margin">Iohn. 1.<hi>4.</hi> Iohn. 1.<hi>16.</hi>
                  </note> all the graces of the holie Ghoſt, forſomuch as hée was made man, we are to receiue from out of his fulneſſe, grace, for grace. Wherefore, by him it is, that wee muſt haue fauoure before God: For if we would drawe neare vnto his Maieſtie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this meane, we were neuer able to haue acceſſe vnto him. And therefore muſt we goe the direct way vnto Ieſus Chriſt, For, ſince we know that he hath moſt perfectly receiued the graces of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, wée muſt be all partakers of them by him and through him. And ſo, Saint Peter vſeth here a verie good reaſon, to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Iewes, that the Redéemer was come, to wit, that in as much as the holie Ghoſt was poured out, that it was in the latter dayes. And beſides, hée ſaieth, <hi>Ye men of Iſrael, heare theſe words: Ieſus of Nazareth, a man approued of God, amongſt you, with wonders, myracles, &amp; ſignes, which God did by him in the midſt of you, as you your ſelues alſo know: him, I ſay, being deliuered by the determined counſell and prouidence of God, you haue by wicked handes crucified and ſlaine.</hi> This is euen hée, by whom God hath wholely giuen him ſelfe vnto you, and yet haue yée put him to death. And yet notwithſtanding yée muſt néedes confeſſe that it is the verie ſelfe ſame man which was promiſed you in the lawe. Hée came to be your Sauiour and Redéemer: and this you can neither will nor chooſe but acknowledge, becauſe he remained not in death: For God gaue him victorie ouer death, and hée ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came it. Thus we ſée in the firſt place, what it is that Saint Peter telleth vnto the Iewes, that he might bring them to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:7663:197"/>
               <p>And it is to be noted, that hée ſpeaketh of nothing here, but of the death, and reſurrection of Ieſus Chriſt. For firſt of all, it can not be otherwiſe, but that the Iewes muſt néedes vnderſtand that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt was the Sonne of God. And this is it whereby Saint Peter meaneth to proue it, in that which hée héere propoundeth. Nowe, there are two thinges, which we are to vnderſtand of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, That we muſt néedes beléeue, that he is the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, to wit, the annointed of the Lord, promiſed in the lawe, and the verie ſame, of whom the Prophets haue written: and that it is he who ſuffred death for our redemption: and yet was not ouercome of it, but gloriouſly roſe againe, tryumphing ouer all his enemies. And thus much for the firſt point. Nowe, for the ſeconde, when as wée know that Ieſus Chriſt dyed for vs, we muſt néedes acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge what hée is, and the benefit which we are to receiue by him: Here are then two thinges throughly to be conſidered of vs: For, if wée haue to deale with a Iewe, wée muſt begin to inſtruct him in the principles of Chriſtianitie, and tell him that Ieſus Chriſt was borne of the Virgine Mary, and that it was hée whom God had promiſed them, and whom in verie déede his predeceſſours had put to death: and that he appointed them the verie time when hée ſhould come into the world. And beſides, that he had giuen him a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony that he was his Sonne, by approuing it with the ſignes and myracles which he did in the middeſt of them: and likewyſe, that after he was aſcended into heauen, he ſent the holy Ghoſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſaying which long ere that, was foretolde. Thus muſt we deale with a Iewe, to bring him to the knowledge of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, we muſt let him vnderſtand, that when the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Meſſiah is ſpoken of in the ſcripture, that it is a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall kingdome, to the ende hée ſhould not be deceiued, to thinke him to be an earthly King, as all the Iewes imagined. And this is it which cauſed them to refuſe Ieſus Chriſt, forſomuch as he reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not ouer the people, as they thought hée ſhoulde haue done. Nowe, for the firſt point, wée haue nothing wherefore to ſtande againſt the Papiſtes, but for the ſecond. For they graunt vnto vs that Ieſus Chriſt is the Sonne of God, and the ſame that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the law: and that hée was put to death, and roſe agayne.
<pb facs="tcp:7663:198"/> And héerein we eaſily agrée. But they are to be taught to what end hee came: For they doe not acknowledge him to be the ſame man in déede that hée is. Wée knowe, that we muſt beléeue, that our ſaluation commeth by Ieſus Chriſt alone, &amp; by his death and paſſion. And the Papiſtes, cleane contrary, attribute it vnto their workes, and merittes, and other their inuentions: and thinke, by that meane to be ſanctified. Wherefore, they ſéeke in their workes the thing, which can no way be founde, but in Ieſus Chriſt. Thus we ſee that it is not néedefull for vs to teach the Papiſtes any thing as concerning the perſon of Ieſus Chriſt, but onely to ſhewe them what his power and vertue is, wherefore hée came, and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite we may reape thereby. Nowe, Saint Peter hath héere taken vpon him, to ſet foorth theſe two pointes: For the Iewes, knewe not that Ieſus Chriſt was the Meſſiah ſent from God, and therefore much leſſe knew they his power, and why he came. And therefore hée telleth them that he ſhewed himſelfe to be the Sonne of God amongſt them, in as much as he roſe againe: ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that by his reſurrection they might know him to be the verie ſame, becauſe hée was deliuered from death and ouercame it: and therefore, that life and ſaluation, muſt be had in him and by him. And this is it which Saint Peter meaneth to declare in this firſt place: he will alſo ſhewe vs what fruit we haue by his reſurrection, which wée meane to declare hereafter, as it commeth in order to be handled. Nowe, ſéeing we at this preſent, vnderſtand the purpoſe of Saint Peter, and the order of his Sermon, let vs follow it: and learne to acknowledge, that ſo ſoone as God beſtoweth any benefite vpon vs, that it is, becauſe we are the members of Ieſus Chriſt, and not for our workes, nor yet for any other thing that we are any way able to offer vnto him. And therefore let vs haue no more theſe royling imaginations in our heades, as to be perſuaded this way and that, but let vs come to the acknowledging of our ſinnes, and be ſory for them: as we ſée Saint Peter goeth about to bring the Iewes theretoo, héere in this place, when as hée ſpeaketh of the death of Ieſus Chriſt. For, in the firſt place hée accuſeth them, ſaying, <hi>Yee haue ſlaine him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nowe, we may verie well ſée, that hée meaneth not by this ſpéech to flatter them.</p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:7663:198"/>
               <p>And indéede S. Peter did caſt this in their diſh, as we ſay, to the end he might pricke their hearts, and wound them to the quicke: as hereafter we ſhal ſée, that it ſo ſtuck, &amp; grieued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the hearts, as that they were therewith conuerted. Thus and by this meane muſt men be wonne to come to be humbled, and brought to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of their offences. For, if we continually preach vnto them pleaſant and delightfull things, they will doe nothing els but toy and tryfle, and be Gods fellowes, and play with him euen as they would doe with a mortall man. We ſée how it fared with the woman of Samaria, when ſhe ſpake vnto Ieſus Chriſt, and that he told her of the water of lyfe, whereof (he ſaid) if ſhe drunke,<note place="margin">Iohn. 4.<hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> that ſhe ſhoulde neuer thirſt, ſhe mocked him like a naughtie packe as ſhe was. But after he had once brought her to the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her ſinne, and tolde her that ſhe went to ſeeke her huſbande, and remembred her of her wicked life paſt, ſhe was more milde in her ſpeech then ſhe was at the firſt. For when he ſimplye and plainely layde before her, the graces of God, ſhe laughed him to ſkorne, and ſayd, why, where ſhall we haue a Bucket wherewith to draw the water, ſéeing the well is ſo very deepe? but when hée had ſaide vnto her, Thou art an harlot: thou haſt had fiue huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes, and he whom thou now haſt is not thy huſband, ſhe then acknowledged her ſinne, and ſayde that Ieſus Chriſt was an holy Prophet. And therefore vntill ſuch time as we tremble at the horror of our ſinnes, we will neuer giue place vnto the woord of God, And that was the cauſe that made Saint Peter accuſe the Iewes of the ſlaying of Chriſt, not that he tooke any pleaſure in thus reproouing of them, but to the ende they might vnderſtande that their condemnation was at hande for their ſinnes: and on the other ſide, that they had forgiuenes of them by Ieſus Chriſt, if they woulde acknowledge him and come vnto him. Nowe, héere in this place haue the miniſters of God a rule ſet downe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, to witte, that they muſt touch men to the quick, and tell them of their ſinnes, that they might vnderſtand that God is their Iudge, and will not leaue their obſtinate ſinning vnpuniſhed: and by that meane be brought backe vnto him by repentance: which they wil neuer doe except they be reprooued and roughly handled. And therefore let vs ſuffer GOD too rule and condemne
<pb facs="tcp:7663:199"/> vs, to the end he might pardon vs. We ſhal finde a greate number of men that would be very glad the Goſpel ſhould bee preached, ſo that it might be for their gaine, &amp; ſerue their carnall deſires, and be as it were a cloake for their villanies. Now, this muſt not bee the end of our preaching: For our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſaide, That when the holy Ghoſt ſhould come, that he ſhould rebuke the world of ſinne: that hée ſhoulde ſit as a Iudge in the place of iuſtice, and iudge the world.<note place="margin">Iohn. 16.<hi>8.</hi>
                  </note> And therfore wée ſhal neuer bée able to deale faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with the Goſpel, without the worlde bée brought to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and that euery man may know what it is, for euerie of vs to rebuke himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Wherfore, let all ſuch as flatter themſelues, groane and bée hartily ſory: and let al ſuch as take their pleaſures, be afeard and tremble: and let all thoſe who perſwade themſelues to bée righteous, looke more narrowly vnto themſelues, to the ende wée might all bee brought to this acknowledging of our ſinnes, by which wée ſhall grow to be penitent, &amp; ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently come into the fauour of God. Thus wée ſée why it is that S. Peter vſeth ſuch a bitter reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion vnto the Iewes, whenas hée ſaith:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That they had crucified and ſlayne Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> And afterwarde ſaith, <hi>being deliuered by the determined Counſell and foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.</hi> As if hée ſhould haue ſaid, Although hée was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by wicked handes, and that you haue put him to death, yet was it not done without the wil of God. Now, it is not for naught that S. Peter added this ſaying, <hi>by the determined Counſel &amp; fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God:</hi> For the Iewes might haue replied and ſayd, If it be ſo that the ſame Chriſt Ieſus of whom thou ſo much ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt of, be the Meſſias, why hath hée ſuffred himſelfe to be thus tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and put to death? And this is a thing that will hardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them: For wée ſée euen at this day how they mocke &amp; ſcorne at it, ſaying, If Ieſus Chriſt had béen the Sonne of GOD, how is it poſſible that hée would abide the ſhamefull death of the croſſe? And thus doe the wicked vomite out this blaſphemie, by reaſon of the obiect of the croſſe, becauſe they think to be a thing derogatorie from the Maieſtie of the ſonne of God. And therefore S Peter pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth theſe fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taſies, which might be a let vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Iewes to beléeue his doctrine. And telleth them that none of all this geare came by fortune (as might haue béene iudged) but euen by the will of God.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:7663:199"/> Now if wée rightly conſidered of the power of God, wée ſhoulde be cleane voyde of al theſe fond imaginations. For, wee know, that God is not without wit, and reaſon, and that whatſoeuer hée did, hée did it méerely for the ſaluation of mankinde. His reſurrection alſo, is diligently to bee obſerued of vs, for as the death of Ieſus Chriſt might giue vs occaſion of offence, if wée conſidered of it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by it ſelfe, euen ſo, in his reſurrection we ſée the woonderful pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er &amp; glory of God, which might make vs not to bée offended what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer troubles and fantaſies ariſe. And therfore S. Peter ſaid, not without cauſe, that that which Ieſus Chriſt ſuffred, was doone by the foreknowledge of God. For it muſt néedes come to paſſe, that Ieſus Chriſt muſt bée the offred vp ſacrifice, vnto God his Father, to blot out the ſinnes of the worlde. Wherefore, when wee ſée the Counſell of God tend to ſuch an end, let vs vnderſtand, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is done, is done for our benefit, &amp; neuer enquire why Ieſus Chriſt ſuffred, becauſe we ſée therin, the infinite goodnes of God: we ſée (as S. Paul ſaith) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue which appeareth vnto vs:<note place="margin">Tit. 3.4.</note> in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not his onely begotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſonne, but deliuered him to death for our ſakes. On y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other ſide, we ſée how obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Ieſus Chriſt was to god his father: let vs not therfore be ſo preſumptuous, as to enter into theſe fooliſh thoughts, and ſay, why doth God this, or that? For, wée know that whatſoeuer hée hath ordeyned, is grounded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fatherly loue which he beareth vs. And ſo, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wée looke at this, we the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſée why it is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt Ieſus ſuffred. This therfore, is the reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherfore S. Peter ſaith, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God had decréed this in his vncha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geable counſel. Moreouer, he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this ſhould be done by the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of the wicked &amp; vngodly. Wherin we ſée, that it is in the wicked, to hurt the godly: but that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doe nothing w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out the ſufferance of God: neither can we haue a more excellent ſpectacle héerin, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the very perſon of Ieſus Chriſt. For we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not chooſe but know, that whatſoeuer he ſuffred, was long agoe foretold by the Prophets. It is ſaid, that he was nayled on the Croſſe, becauſe it was ſo foretold. Thus we ſée how theſe théeuiſh Romaniſts crucify him (to wit, the ſouldiers vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted) becauſe it was ſo propheſied. They gaue him very ſharpe &amp; bitter drinke, to drinke:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 19.24.28.</note> they parted his garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: &amp; al this they did, becauſe it was ſo writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. To be ſhort, there was nothing done in this, but that which God had before ordeined. Thus we ſée that the wicked can doe nothing
<pb facs="tcp:7663:200"/> without God giue them leaue. For we ſée, that theſe vngodly ones could goe no farther then God had licenſed them. And therefore whatſoeuer is ſaid of Ieſus Chriſt is to be applied to our vſe, for he himſelfe hath ſayd, that the little ſparrowes ſhall not fall on the ground without his ordenance. If ſo be then that the prouidence of God extendeth it ſelfe vnto theſe ſmall foules,<note place="margin">Mat. <hi>10.</hi>29</note> it muſt needes fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, that nothing commeth to paſſe without his appointment, he ſayeth after that, that the hayres of our head are numbred, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, he ſheweth the fatherly care which he hath ouer vs, and beſides, becauſe we are the members of Ieſus Chriſt, and touch him very neere, he would haue vs vnderſtand, that he taketh vs for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. For although the world be as it were the houſe of God, and he the Goodman of the houſhold, yet doeth hee ſingulerly reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and like his Church, and hath a ſpeciall care thereof. And therefore wee ſee, what wee are to thinke of the prouidence of god, to wit, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> S. Peter would haue no fantaſtical things ſet down, nor yet haue vs ſerch after ſubtilties, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> edifie not. His meaning then, is not to procéede after any ſuch ſort: but ſheweth that God hath ſo well prouided for our ſaluation, as that we neede not ſéeke for any other meane, but that onely which he hath appointed. And beſids, he would haue vs vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are ſo ſure vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hand of God &amp; his protection, as that nothing can be done againſt vs, but that which he hath determined, For if it were not ſo, what ſhould become of vs, if we were guided by fortune (as mad men think we are) ſurely our eſtate were more accurſed then the eſtate of brute beaſts. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>as we vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> god is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gouernour of al things this ought greatly to comfort vs, &amp; we might theron very well ſtay our ſelues. Wherfore we ſée it to be a neceſſary vertue to know y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of god. And therfore we are to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as Ieſus Chriſt ſuffred nothing, but by Gods permiſſion, euen ſo, whatſoeuer ſhal betide vs co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, this then is it w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are to obſerue here in this place. Yea, &amp; we are throughly to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider of this word <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi> Indéed there are ſome men which wil ſpeake of the prouidence of God, but it ſhalbe but a fooliſh imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof, for they thinke that he himſelfe taketh his eaſe in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue, &amp; giueth fortune or nature leaue to rule here below. Now, we are contrariwiſe here told, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God ordeyneth al things, &amp; diſpoſeth euery thing at his will &amp; pleaſure. True it is that the ſame is vnknown to vs, neither can we comprehende it: but we muſt be onely contented to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:7663:200"/> that hee is the Gouernour thereof: neither muſt wee as I haue already ſaid) doe as ſome fooliſhe felowes doe, who ſay. And if God knoweth what ſhal come to paſſe: it is not for vs to ſet downe any order, and therefore to what ende ſhould we vſe counſell &amp; aduiſe? Thus wee ſée what reaſon theſe fantaſtical felowes woulde yéelde vnto their follies, which are ouer greate arrogancies, for God to leaue vnpuniſhed. For, although god calleth vs not into his ſecret counſel to declare vnto vs his wil, &amp; determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet let vs know y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he gouerneth vs by his hand, &amp; that the wicked can doe nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, except the Lorde geueth them leaue. And yet there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth a certayne order in nature: &amp; the meaning therof is not, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we muſt vſe aduiſe: for God hath ſaide vnto vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he woulde haue vs liue by the bread which he giueth vs to eate, &amp; that our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes ſhould be healed by phiſick. Wherfore, it were ouer great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancie for vs, to refuſe the meanes, which God giueth vs, to cure &amp; helpe our infirmities, And he that thinketh to get honour by this meane, ſhal bring himſelf to vtter deſtruction. For when wée ſay, that the prouidence of God prouideth for al things, yet muſt wée not refuſe the meane which he hath appoynted. Saint Peter ſaith a little after this, that it was impoſſible for the fleſhe of the bodie of Ieſus Chriſt to turne to corruption. And why ſo? becauſe that God only had ſo ordained it: and not that it could doe naturally ſo. For when he was conceiued in the wombe of the Virgin Mary, he tooke vpon him our nature, and was made like vnto vs, ſinne excepted. And by that reaſon, his fleſhe was ſubiect to corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euen as ours is, if God had not in that ſort preuented it.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15.</note> If a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had ſéen the bones of our lord Ieſus Chriſt, they might wel enough haue béen bruiſed &amp; broken: &amp; yet we ſée y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was impoſſible for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be ſo, becauſe that God had in ſuch ſort appoynted it, &amp; that they were not naturally ſo: here we ſée, what we haue to note, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning that which might be alledged out of this place: not that wee are to deale in ſpeculatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; to inuent a thouſand ſophiſticall or brabling queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, wherin the papiſts are cunning: but let vs in al hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blenes conſideratly ſtay our ſelues vpon this, that GOD doeth not onely foreſée all thinges, but deſpoſeth them alſo at his will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. And therefore, let vs learne to commende our ſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him,<note place="margin">Iohn. <hi>12.</hi>31.</note> whenas we abide the grieuous aſſaults of the diuel &amp; of the world, whereof he is ſaide to be the Prince: and when wée thinke
<pb facs="tcp:7663:201"/> that it cannot be choſen but that the wicked wil oppreſſe vs,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 12.31.</note> let vs ſhroud our ſelues vnder the wings of our good God, that he might giue vs wherewith to reſiſt them: and ſo, being armed with his power, wée may bee able to put by all the temptations that may come vnto vs. For, although all the Diuels, &amp; wicked ones would ryſe vp againſt vs, hee knoweth well enough how to bridle them, and hold them faſt bounde, ſo that wee (as wee haue before ſaide) runne vnto him, and reſt vnder his protection. Thus wée ſée that we muſt looke vpon the prouidence of God by faith, and not after our owne reaſon.</p>
               <p>Now, in that we haue ſaide, that the wicked doe nothing but that which God ordeineth: a number might reply and ſay, what good ſir, and if it bée thus, it might bée ſaid, that God ſhoulde bée the cauſe of the euill, and the wicked were to bée excuſed. For anſwere hereof, we muſt in the firſt place vnderſtand, what the will of god is, yea &amp; that he ſetteth downe vnto vs in his law. We know that he hath forbidden ſtealing. If then I goe &amp; ſteale, What? Doe I then his will? Surely, when the wicked goe about to doe any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, they goe not to doe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wil of God, for they know wel enough that God vtterly miſliketh al wicked dealing. And therefore when they doe any euill, they withſtand the will of God.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, it followeth that God would not haue them doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny euill: but ſuffereth them to doe it: &amp; for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe they are in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeable, forſomuch as they doe contrary to his commaundement. And therefore we muſt not ſay that God is the cauſe of euill: for he committeth not the faultes which wée commit. For wée ſée, that he giueth the Diuell leaue to puniſh ſuch are worthie thereof. The Diuell committeth euill, and hath none other regard but to doe miſchiefe, and yet God maketh him to ſerue him to another cleane contrary end. God ſuffereth a Théefe to robbe a true man of his goods.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.21.</note> And why doeth he ſo? Forſooth to prooue his pacience, that it might be knowne. We ſée what Iob ſaith in all his troubles, The Lorde hath giuen, and the Lorde hath taken, bleſſed be the name of the Lord. And yet théeues robbed and ſpoyled him. What meaneth hée then hereby? Doth Iob accuſe God of theft? No forſooth, you muſt not ſo take it: for hée knewe that théeues were wicked, and that they came not thither but againſt the will of God, and to the intent to doe miſchiefe: howbeit he had a further reach, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:7663:201"/> that it was not done without the prouidence of God.</p>
               <p>And therefore Iob attributed not the wicked déede vnto God: but hée knew what men were in their kind. Hée ſaw that the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans and Sabeans, were the ſcourges of God, They robbed, and reaued, they killed his ſeruants, and draue away his Cattel, to bée ſhort, they impoueriſhed him and lefte him nothing: and yet hée continually prayſed God, becauſe hée right wel knew, that it was not done without his ordinaunce. And euen ſo muſt wée doe: For if the wicked trouble vs, wée muſt not looke vnto them, but our faith muſt aſcend a great deale higher, to wit, wée muſt vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that the prouidence of God is aboue them al. After this ſort then muſt wée iudge, and not enter into vaine ſpeculations. Wée ſée now at this preſent, that the vngodly crucified Ieſus Chriſt, and yet was it not done without the ordinance of God. Howbéeit God wrought it to another ende. It was the will of the wicked to bring Ieſus Chriſt to naught: and it was the will of God, that his blood and death ſhould bée an euerlaſting Sacrifice, and our redemption to bée made, and accompliſhed thereby.</p>
               <p>And therefore when wée behold this, wée haue occaſion to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie GOD: and hée that doth not ſo, his owne conſcience reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him. Nowe, S. Peter ſaieth, that Ieſus Chriſt roſe agayne, wherby to ſhew (as we haue already ſaid) that wée muſt alwaies ioyne his reſurrection with his death: For if wée looke into his death onely, wée ſhall ſée him altogether full of all ſhame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche, and diſfigured like a Leper. But when wée come vnto his reſurrection, wée ſée how mightily the hand of God exalted him, giuing him al power both in heauen and earth, Wherefore,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18.</note> ſo ſoone as wée haue ſaide that Ieſus died: let vs by and by vnderſtande, that hée roſe againe. He died according to the weakneſſe of his fleſh but in that hée roſe againe, he ſhewed himſelfe to bée the very ſonne of God.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſée the meaning of Saint Peter his woords when hée ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Whom God raiſed vp, being deliuered to death.</hi> Now,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4.</note> in that hée ſaieth, The ſorrowes of death, hée meaneth not the ſorrowes of the bodily death, which Ieſus Chriſt ſuffered, but the horrible an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes wherein hée was becauſe he was to bée our pledge, &amp; beare the puniſhment of all our ſinnes. Wherefore, hée ſuffered not only in body: but alſo in ſpirit: and yet was hée not for al that ouercome:
<pb facs="tcp:7663:202"/> But becauſe we cannot at this preſent, go on with the declaration of the ſorrowes of his death, as is very behouefull: wée therefore will reſerue it vntill the next time.</p>
               <p>According to this doctrine, let vs fall downe before the maieſtie of our good God, and acknowledge our offences, beſéeching him ſo to touch vs with the confeſſing of them, as that although we haue héeretofore giuen the reine to our affections, yet y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it woulde pleaſe him to hold vs in, that wée might bée obedient vnto his worde: and ſo in pardoning of our offences paſt, not rigorouſly iudge vs, but accept thoſe graces and thankſgiuing which wée yéelde vnto him, for all the benefites which he hath beſtowed vpon vs. And ſo let vs all ſay, O Almightie God and heauenly Father. &amp;c.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ne of the principalleſt Articles of our faith is this, that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte muſt appeare from heauen. Now, it cannot be, that his comming ſhoulde bée vnprofitable: and therfore it neceſſarily followeth, that we muſt looke and wait for our redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſaluation from thence. Neither muſt wée ſtand any whit in doubt thereof, becauſe if wée ſhoulde ſo doe, it were euen enough to make whatſoeuer our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte hath doone and ſuffered, of none effect. For, why came hée downe into the worlde, why tooke hée our fleſhe vpon him, why ſuffered hée vpon the Croſſe, why roſe hée againe, and why aſcended hée into heauen? Forſooth hée did all this, to this ende and purpoſe, that hée woulde gather vs together into his kingdome, whenas hée ſhall appeare. And therfore this his comming, is as it were to ſeale and ratifie all whatſoeuer hée hath doone and indured, for our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
            <p>Nowe this were euen ſufficient to ſtay vs, for the reſiſting of all the temptations in the world: but becauſe wée are ſo fraile and inconſtant, as that wée cannot beléeue the thing which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſaith, Saint Paule now vſeth a ſtrange kinde of Argument, the better to confirme vs in this hope, whereunto hée hath exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs in the perſon of the Theſſalonians: which is, That GOD will not be ſo lightly ſet by, by the contemners of his Goſpell, who make no reckoning of his heauenly Maieſtie: neither will hée ſuffer his creatures to lift them ſelues vp againſt him, &amp; to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him. Thus wée ſée, by howe much more wée ſhoulde bée confirmed, in the hope of our ſaluation, ſéeing that God hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt therein, &amp; is his owne cauſe. And this is a point which wée are diligently to obſerue. For although (as I haue alredy ſaid) God excéedingly aſſureth vs y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath great care of our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet our nature is ſo wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfull miſtruſtful, as that we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually ſtand in doubt. But when it is ſet down vnto vs, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> god wil defend his own right, and not ſuffer vs to treade his maieſtie vnder foote, this is a doctrine which ſhoulde make<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vs full aſſured and reſolute.</p>
            <p>And beſides, GOD ſheweth vs ſuch fauour in ioyning his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb facs="tcp:7663:203"/> with our ſaluation, as that there is an inſeparable bonde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the one and the other. For, doe not wée ſée an infallible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, that our Lord Ieſus will come to giue vs reſt and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, becauſe it cannot otherwiſe bée but that God will mainteyn his maieſtie againſt the pride and enmitie of men? And therefore let vs diligently marke, that Ieſus Chriſt cannot mainteyne the glory of his father, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he muſt eftſoones declare himſelf to be our redéemer. And theſe things (as I haue ſaid) cannot bée ſundered. Wherefore wée héerein ſée the infinite loue of our God towardes his faythfull ones, whenas hée conioyneth himſelf in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uch ſort with them, for as hée cannot poſſibly forget his owne glorie, no more can hée alſo forget our ſaluation: and as hée will ſhew his power to be reuenged of al ſuch as reſiſt him, euen ſo will hée likewiſe puniſhe all thoſe that haue vniuſtly afflicted his choſen people. Thus wée ſée, what S. Paule his meaning is, when as hée ſayeth that Ieſus Chriſt wil come to render vengeance to al thoſe which haue not knowne God, and obeyed his Goſpel. As if hée ſhould haue ſaid Behold your enimies which perſecuted you. Nowe, you were in doubt whether God regarded your afflictions, and whether hée had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion of you or not, for the remedying of them. What? Thinke you that GOD maketh no reckoning to mainteyne and defend his glory? Nowe, as the Aduerſaries afflict you for cleauing vnto the Goſpel, euen ſo likewiſe will God, in the defence of his own cauſe, bée your Protector and defendor. And by the way, S. Paule alſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs here in this place many profitable aduertiſementes. For, when hée ſpeaketh of the vengeance which is prepared for our eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, hée ſaith, <hi>That Ieſus Chriſt will come with the Angels of his power, and in flaming fire.</hi> But to what ende? Forſooth, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme his ſaying: to wit, that the enimies of his truth (ſaieth hée) might ſuſtaine their puniſhment, both before God, and his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie. As if hée ſhould haue ſaid, ſurely, you can no more comprehend the torment which the faithleſſe ſhall ſuffer: then wée doe ſée the glorie of God. For when wée heare the glorie of God ſpoken of, we know it to bée without end, and meaſure, and therefore wée ought to woonder at it. Euen ſo fareth it with the horrible vengeaunce which is prepared for all the faithleſſe: Séeing God muſt ſhewe foorth his power vpon them. For ſince his Maieſtie (as I haue ſaid) is ineſtimable, therefore muſt their torment be alſo incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:7663:203"/> for our cauſe, and thus much for this poynt.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, when S. Paule ſpeaketh of Infidels, and of the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God, hée ſaieth, <hi>That they knew him not, nor yet obeyed his Goſpel,</hi> Or that they were Rebels, and this kind of ſpéech im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth a very profitable doctrine. For if a man ſhoulde aſke the moſt wicked men that were poſſibly to be found out, whether they would make warre againſt God or not, they would ſurely ſay no: and yet for all that, they do cleane contrary to their words, becauſe they will not fully and wholy ſubmit themſelues vnto the Goſpel. And how is that? It is ſaide that wée cannot obey God without faith: For marke how Saint Paul ſpeaketh thereof aſwell in the Epiſtle to the Romans, as in the Actes of the Apoſtles.<note place="margin">Rom. <hi>1.</hi>8. Actes. 6.<hi>7.</hi>
               </note> Sith it is ſo, (ſaith hée) that faith is ſuch a true and right obedience as god requireth &amp; liketh of, it neceſſarily followeth, that all they which will not beléeue the Goſpel, are his enimies, and doe what in them lyeth to ſet themſelues againſt him,</p>
            <p>Now, if they ſay they haue no ſuch meaning, it is all one, &amp; the caſe ſo ſtandeth for all that. We are hereby taught that our ſeruice cannot pleaſe God, without wee firſt beléeue the Goſpell, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of all therein conteined, for our humbling, To bée ſhort, faith is the chiefeſt thing that God requireth at our handes. In very déede wée are to note this by the way, that faith ſimply leadeth vs not to conſent vnto that which is taught vs, but that wée muſt withall, bring our heartes and affections with vs: For wée muſt not only accept of that, that is ſaid vnto vs, with our mouthes, or in a fantaſticall maner, but it muſt bée imprinted in our heartes, and we muſt alſo vnderſtand, that it is not lawfull for vs to ſtand againſt our God.</p>
            <p>And therefore, let vs with a true deſire craue to ſticke vnto the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which is offered vs. Faith then is in the heart, and there ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth roote, and is no ſimple and bare knoweledge: For if wée were once brought to beléeue that the doctrine of the Goſpel is true, and yet wée in the meane while coulde finde no ſauour in it, but were gréeued and wéeried with it, were this to bée obedient vnto it? No ſurely. Let vs learne then to obey God, and take not the doctrine of the Goſpell to bee good, and holy onely, but let vs alſo loue it: and not only loue it, but alſo reuerence it: accordingly as Dauid ſpeaketh of the Lawe, where hee ſaith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.11.</note> That hee thought it to bee
<pb facs="tcp:7663:204"/> ſwéeter then hony, and more precious then golde or ſiluer. And therefore, wee muſt haue the doctrine of the Goſpell in ſuche an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimation and priſe, and chiefly, it muſt be euen ſo ſwéet, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant vnto vs.</p>
            <p>Now, when wée ſhall thus doe: then (as I haue ſaide) will God like of our obedience. This then is the moſt worthie ſeruice which hée deſireth at our handes. For els, it is a wiſe thing for vs, to doe this or that, becauſe that whatſoeuer wee ſhall take in hand to doe will ſtincke before the face of God, vntyll ſuch time as wée beléeue the Goſpell. And heerein may bée ſéene the miſerable eſtate and condition of the Papiſtes: for they excéedingly torment them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with their religions, as they call them: they thinke that god is greatly beholden vnto them, whenas they haue plaid y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Idiots, as they doe: and when they haue babbled out their Pater Noſters, hearde a number of Maſſes, trotted on Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and ſpent their money abhominably, they thinke that God ſhould allowe all this geare for currant. But what? Forſooth they want the principall matter, and that is Faith: For admit that theſe thinges in themſelues were good and godly, yet yf men haue not faith, God will account them all, as fond and fooliſh.</p>
            <p>And therefore wée ſée; that the more the Papiſtes goe about to think to ſerue god, the greater condemnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they heape vpon them ſelues, and prouoke his anger to light vpon their heads. And therefore they are héere called the enimies of GOD, becauſe they will not bée ſubiect vnto the doctrine of the Goſpell, well Good ſir, will they ſay, you ſée that our meaning is to ſerue God, and this, and that wée doe, to the ſame ende. Yée ſay well, But behold how God inuiteth you vnto himſelfe, hée telleth you that all your feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie and bleſſedneſſe reſteth in his onely méere fauour and mercy, and woulde haue you ſéeke for no ſaluation but in Chriſte Ieſus alone: hee hath tolde you that hée hath ſent his Sonne vnto you, that you might feele the fruite and effect of his paſſion: and that in his name and for his ſake all your treſpaſſes are pardoned and forgiuen you: and that you ſhoulde looke for none other Aduocate but him, to bring you vnto his Maieſtie: and deſire to bee renued by his holy ſpirite.</p>
            <p>Thus you ſée after what manner the Lord ſpeaketh to you. And you puppetly Papiſts, what doe you? Surely there is nothing but
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7663:204"/> pride and preſumption in you: For you bend all your force againſt all the promiſes which God hath made you, and thinke to gaine by your owne induſtry, the thing which is promiſed you in Ieſus Chriſt: For you truſt in your owne merites and woorkes, you looke after ſuch Patrones and aduocates as you like beſt of, and in the meane while, Chriſt Ieſus is ſhutte cleane out of the doores: without doubt, faith you haue none: and that which is woorſe, yée rebell againſt GOD, and in ſtéede as you thinke, of woorſhipping and honouring him, yée proclayme mortall warres againſt him. Wherefore, wée are highly to magnifie our good GOD for brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vs out of ſo bottomleſſe a pitte, and ſhewing vs the right way howe to ſerue him: to wit, in ſincerely conioyning vs vnto the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpell, receiuing the promiſes which by it is made vnto vs.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, if wée doe perceiue that men are once humbled, this is a right preparatiue to bring them vnto the true ſeruice of God, yea euen to the full and perfecte obedience which GOD liketh of, as already hath béene ſayde, Héere then wée ſée one point, That infidelitie is an enemie to GOD: For there can bée no obedience, without it be begunne by fayth. Nowe, Saint Paule ſaieth, that they which obey not the Goſpel, knowe not God. Wherein wée ſée that ignoraunce ſhall not excuſe, although many there are which woulde fayne make it their defence: and they thinke it ſufficient if they haue not manifeſtly and of ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe offended therein, making this reckoning, that GOD ought to forgiue them euerie whitte. Yea forſooth, But marke that Saint Paule namely ſaith, that Ieſus Chriſt wil come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all thoſe that haue not knowne God.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore vnderſtand, that wée cannot chooſe but bée con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and vtterly ouerthrowen, if ſo bée wée know not him who created vs, &amp; him alſo who redéemed vs And to ſpeake truely, there is great reaſon in it: for why hath God giuen vs wit &amp; vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but to this end, that in knowing of him wée ſhould worſhippe him, and yéeld him that honor which belongeth vnto him.</p>
            <p>We ſée how deſirous we our ſelues are to be eſtéemed and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and yet will wee thruſt him out at the Cartes arſe, as wée ſay, &amp; who made vs? for what purpoſe doe they this? Is it not a thing cleane againſt nature? but let vs by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> way marke that the
<pb facs="tcp:7663:205"/> ignorance of Infidels and incredulous Papiſtes, procéedeth not of méere ſimplicitie, but of very malice, pride and hypocriſie, which cauſeth them to bée ſo cléerely voyd of wit, and diſcretion. And how ſo? becauſe without all doubt, if we might once come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, we could neither will nor chooſe, but hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble our ſelues before him: For it is impoſſible for vs, to bee able to thinke what God is, except wée bée liuely touched with ſome feare, which may make vs yéelde vnto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore, ſo long as wée are Rebels, and his enimies, it is a token that wee neuer knew him: for this knowledge of God, is too too liuely a thing, to ſay, there wée ſée him, and yet bée as obſtinate and rebellious as Infidels. And if any man ſay, that they are ignoraunt, I graunt: but let them take this withall, that they are alſo curſed hypocrites. Is there either one or other of vs, that hath any thing in him, able to excuſe him? No ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for if wée had but the ſéede of nature in vs, giuen by God, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie beholding of heauen and earth, were ynough to make vs think, that there were ſome one who created all theſe thinges: God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealeth vnto vs as it were in a glaſſe his maieſtie and glorie: and yet there is none of vs all that will yéeld vnto it. Surely, the moſte vngodly, and ſuch as make a ſcorne of GOD, whenas they bée in any paine or griefe, will call vpon him, and yet thinke no whit at all indéede of him: and héerevnto doeth GOD driue them, that they might bée without all excuſe, inſomuch that they (as I haue already ſayd) which are moſt incredulous, are not yet ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, but that they play the very Hipocrites. They would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly couer and cloake it: Howbéeit they cloſe vp their eyes for the very nonce. Wée are proude alſo &amp; malicious: for if wée did beare that honour vnto God that wée ought, we would haue another ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of care to ſéeke to know him and his will.</p>
            <p>And therefore, whenas wée are ſo lazie, and colde, it is a token that wée care not for him. So that by that meane our deſire is, to walke altogether in the darke. Why ſo? what is then to bée done? Forſooth, when wée come néere vnto GOD, and that hée rebuketh vs for our offences, wée ſhoulde learne to bée offended with our ſinnes and reforme our liues. Howbéeit, wée are contented to lulle our ſelues aſléepe in our miſeries: and thus wée ſée howe wée flye from his brightnes.</p>
            <p>Wée are therefore héere to note, that we are not puniſhed without
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:7663:205"/> good cauſe, although we bée ignorant: for wée cannot iuſtly ſay, that wée are ſimple, but rather hypocriticall, proud, and malicious. We ſée then why S. Paule ſaith. That they which had ſinned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out law (to wit, they which had no vnderſtanding of the woorde of God) ſhould notwithſtanding die without law, ſaying further, that God had ingraue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a law in euery mans heart: for although we had neither Scripture nor preaching, yet doth our conſciences ſerue for a law to condemne vs: and this ſhalbée ſufficient at the latter day, well, wée may haue many ſtarting holes to deceiue men withall, and wée thinke it a good diſcharge: but when wée come once before the heauenly Iudge, wée ſhal come ſhort of our reckoning, for there wée ſhall ſée all our excuſes to be vaine. Let vs then note out of the ſaying in this place, That the Lord wil come to render vengeance vnto al thoſe which haue not knowne GOD and obeyed the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, to wit, vnto al incredulous perſons. Now, by this wee ſée, that faith is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only port or gate vnto ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; life: becauſe Ieſus Chriſt wil come to confound al thoſe which haue not beléeued.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, we muſt vnderſtand, that vntill ſuch time as GOD enlighteneth vs, wée are altogether ignorant and blind. And why ſo? Forſooth, wée haue a faire catch to know whatſoeuer is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen &amp; in earth, &amp; yet not knowe God, &amp; then to what purpoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth all our knowledge? And ſurely, wée ſhal neuer know him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, vntil ſuch time as hée hath enlightened vs with his holie ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Whervpon we ſée, that our ignorance ſhal not excuſe vs, to the end no man ſhould flatter himſelfe, and become careleſſe: &amp; yet let vs alſo note one thing by the way, that when wee are come to the knowledge of God, wée ought of very right ſubmit our ſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, to the end hee might kéepe vs in awe, that all our thoughts and affections might be guided after his wil: ſo that wée may haue ſuch a faith vnto the Goſpel, as that we may ſay with Dauid,<note place="margin">Pſal. 19.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> that this doctrine is ſweeter then hony, &amp; more precious then gold or ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. And thus much for this poynt.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, wee here ſée, how GOD meaneth to certefie vs of our ſaluation. For if Ieſus Chriſt muſt come to doe vengeaunce vpon all thoſe which haue not beléeued the Goſpel, but reſiſted it: wée muſt néedes conclude, that the worlde ſhall bée iudged by the Goſpel. Nowe, it is there ſayde vnto vs, that when wee haue
<pb facs="tcp:7663:206"/> receiued the promiſes of God with a true and liuely faith, we muſt not ſtand in doubt of his fauour and loue to vs warde, neither yet doubt that Ieſus Chriſte will not ſtande to the thing which hee hath offered for vs and for our redemption.</p>
            <p>And therefore, all they which doe beléeue in the Goſpell, may without all doubt reioyce, that Ieſus Chriſte will come to be their Redéemer. And this aſſurance (as I haue alreadie ſaid) God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs, ſo that wée refuſe not ſuch a benefite. As for the power and glory of Ieſus Chriſte, which Saint Paul héere ſpeaketh of, it is (as hath béene before ſaide) to this ende that his comming might bée the more terrible to all incredulous and rebellious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And is this a ſmall matter, to ſay that Ieſus Chriſte wyll come accompanied with his Angels in flaming fier, and with an incomprehenſible Maieſtie, thundering and lightening vpon all thoſe that are his enimies.</p>
            <p>By this wee ſée that Saint Paule his meaning héere, is to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhe all faithleſſe people, if they are to bée holpen, to beware how they continue ſtill without am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ndment. Notwithſtanding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee ſée that ſuch as Satan leadeth, and whoſe heartes hee hardeneth, doe nothing els but make a mocke at the threatninges of God, let vs for our partes make our profite thereby: and when wée heare that Ieſus Chriſte wyll come in ſuch a feareful maner, as that hee will ſo feare and bridle vs, that when Satan ſhall goe about to ſpurre and pricke vs forwarde, to withdrawe vs from the obedience of the Goſpell, wée might bée able to thinke thus with our ſelues and ſay, how fareth it with vs? how headlong runne we into deſtruction? What meane we to prouoke him againſt vs, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom all maieſtie, power, glory, and dominion is giuen, to caſt down euen into the pit of hell, as many as reſiſt him?</p>
            <p>Now if wée throughly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered of this, without doubt we would kéepe ſo good a hand of our ſelues, as that all the fleſhly luſtes and temptations of the world, ſhould neuer bée able to preuaile againſt vs. Saint Paule alſo meant to make a compariſon betwixt the firſt comming of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, and the ſecond. Why then doe the wicked, and vngodly contemners of the Goſpell, ſo boldly lift vp themſelues, as that they become diſſolute, and ſtarke ſtaring mad. Surely, it is becauſe they heare, that while Ieſus
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:7663:206"/> Chriſte was héere on earth, hée tooke vpon him the ſtate of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7.</note> yea and abaſed himſelfe (and Saint Paule ſaith) euen vnto this moſt ſhamefull and ſlaunderous death. And becauſe the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God vnderſtand ſuch an infirmitie to bée in Ieſus Chriſt, they take vpon them to ſpeak thus wickedly and furiouſly of him: as we ſée it is euen ſo: howbeit, they ſée not, that as hée ſuffered as hée was man, that hée likewiſe roſe againe through the power of his ſpirite: For hée then in ſuch ſort ſhewed foorth his glory, as that both great and ſmall ought to tremble thereat.<note place="margin">2. Cor. <hi>13.</hi>4.</note> But if theſe faithleſſe people are not able to vnderſtand the power that appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the reſurrection of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, let them giue eare to that which is héere ſpoken: to wit, that hée will come in glory.</p>
            <p>For in his firſt comming, hée appeared contemptible, becauſe hée woulde ſhewe him ſelfe obedient in our behalfes, for that hée was to make ſatiſfaction for our ſinnes: But at his ſeconde comming, hée will come to bée our iudge. Hée was iudged and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, that wée might bée deliuered from the iudgement ſeate of God, and bée pardoned of all our ſinnes, Then will hée not que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſſe come in ſuch humble ſort: but will come with his angels in glory. And this is the meaning which Saint Paule woulde haue vs note, to the ende the wicked and faithleſſe might not take occaſion to contemn this his laſt comming, vnder colour y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte once appeared as hée was man, like vnto vs, and was made like vnto a worme of the earth, as it is ſaide in the Pſalme: and as Iſaiah ſayeth, hée was diſfigured from toppe to toe, all to wounded, and that for our redemption. For ſince hee accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed that, which the iuſtice of God required, there remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned nothing, but that hee ſhoulde ſhewe himſelfe in this glory, which was appointed for him: For wée knowe (as Saint Paule ſayeth) That hée hath giuen him a name aboue all names,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9.</note> that al the Creatures in Heauen, Earth, and Hell ſhould bowe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: that euery thing ſhoulde tremble at his excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, which alſo the deſpiſers of his Goſpell ſhoulde well know, to their paine though late firſt.</p>
            <p>Thus wee ſee what the Apoſtle Saint Paul his pretenſe is, when hee ſayeth, That his comming ſhall bee fearefull.
<pb facs="tcp:7663:207"/> Let vs alſo eftſoones mark y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which followeth, <hi>That he ſhall come to appeare meruellous, and to be glorified in his Saintes.</hi> Now it is not for nothing that Saint Paule ſetteth downe this ſaying: for what are wee, that wée ſhoulde be able to abide the preſence of the Sonne of God, whenas hee ſhall come in flambing fier. And therefore, when hee ſhall come with an incomprehenſible power. Alas, muſt not we néedes melt before him, as Snowe before the Sunne, and come to nothing. Loe, howe we ſhoulde bee caſte downe whenas wée doe but onely heare the heauenly glory of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte ſpoken of: But Saint Paule ſheweth vs, that if wée bee of the faithfull ſorte, that we muſt not be afraide at the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, neither yet waxe ſorowfull and melancholike at the brightneſſe of his Maieſtie. And why ſo? Becauſe (ſayeth hée) hee will bee glorified, and made wonderfull in his Saintes. As if he ſhoulde haue ſaide, that the mention which he before made of the flambing fier, and of the horror and feare, was not to diſcourage the faithfull ones, as though they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired not the comming of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and as though they helde not vp their heads as often as they hearde it ſpoken of: becauſe hée ſhall come to redéeme them. And this is a doctrine which is very common in the holy Scriptures: to wit, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our Lord ioyneth theſe two thinges together. That hee will come to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged of his enimies, and to deliuer his people: that hee will come to ſaue al thoſe that haue ſerued and honored him, and to caſt downe and confounde all thoſe, who haue hardened them ſelues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte him, and his worde.</p>
            <p>Let vs nowe then kéepe in minde that this terrible deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which héere before hath béene ſet downe, is not to make vs ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull and melancholike: But rather to make vs ioyfull and glad, whenas wée ſée what loue and fauour God beareth vs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde, our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte will come, and that terribly. And wherfore will hée do ſo? Forſooth, euen to throwe downe headlong all his enimies, and to take vengeance of al the ſhames and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which we haue abidden, How ſo I beſéech you? Are wee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie that the Sonne of God ſhould powre out his Maieſtie, &amp; ſhewe himſelfe ſo terribly againſt all his creatures for our cauſes? No, without doubt: But yet will hée doe ſo, forſomuch as he loueth vs This then is it which I haue alreadie ſaid, that we might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:7663:207"/> when as we heare it ſaide, That the Sonne of God will come ſo horribly and fearefully. For herein, he effectually ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the infinite loue hee beareth vs, in that hee ſpareth not his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and Maieſtie to take vengeance of all the wrongs which haue béene done to vs.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe, we ſhall neuer be able to féele the ſauour of it, without this thing be obſerued, which Saint Paule namely ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe in this place: to wit, that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt will not come, to be onely reuenged of his enemies, and of all ſuch as haue been enimies vnto his Goſpel but alſo, <hi>To bee glorified, and made wonderfull in his ſaints, and in thoſe which haue beleeued.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe, whenas Sainte Paul did ſet downe this, it is aſmuch as if he had ſaide, that hee would come to make vs partakers of his glory: That whatſoeuer is in him, worthie reuerence and honor all that, I ſay, ſhall be communicated vnto vs. To be ſhort, S. Paule ſaieth, That our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt ſhall not come him ſelfe alone, and kéepe his glorie to him ſelfe, but to the end it might be poured out vpon all the members of his bodie. And for this cauſe we ſée it is ſaide in the Colloſſians, That our life lyeth nowe hid,<note place="margin">Col. 3.<hi>3.</hi>
               </note> but that it ſhall appeare at the comming of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt. And therefore hée ſhall not come perticulerly for him ſelfe, and for his owne glorie alone, but rather that we might be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers therof: and not in ſuch ſort neither, but that he alwayes hath a great prerogatiue ouer his children, for it is good reaſon he ſhould be the head of his Church. And to ſay the trueth, the glory which hée communicateth with vs, is not derogatorie from his, neyther yet is it therby made any whit leſſe, howbeit we muſt be tranſfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as Saint Paule ſaieth to the Phillippians:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21.</note> and where wée are nowe ſo full of infirmities as is lamentable, it cannot be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen but that our life muſt be made like vnto the heauenly life of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And ſo, when Saint Paule ſpake after that maner, hée namely had regarde vnto the ſtate of the faythfull, as it is in this worlde: For we are noted, pointed at with the finger, and our tongues pulde out: wée ſée howe the wicked and vngodly make a ieſt at the children of God: and it is méete we ſhoulde bée made thus contemtible, to the end we might learne to looke for no glorie here in this worlde. Howbeit, God will, when it pleaſeth him, haue vs exalted aboue them all: but his meaning, in the mean
<pb facs="tcp:7663:208"/> while, is, that we ſhould ſuffer ſuch ſlaunders and reproches, that we might looke vp into heauen, and ſéeke for our triumph and vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, there. For, to what purpoſe were it, for vs to be glorified and made much of here in this life, and to haue God in the meane time to be diſhonoured? In verie déede, the wicked with open mouth make a ſcorne of God: and make no reckoning of them, which wil not ſpit in his Maieſties face. And would we then be honoured by them? Surely, if we ſhould deſire it, muſt it not néedes be ſaid, that we are too too faint hearted. Wherefore, according to my firſt ſaying: that forſomuch as the faithfull, are at this preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, and naught ſet by: and that ſome laugh them to ſcorne, and other ſome oppreſſe them: ſo that their fleſh is eaten to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bones, and troaden cleane vnder foote, therefore the Apoſtle calleth vs backe vnto the latter day, ſaying, That we ſhall at that tyme ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare wonderfull, euen like vnto the Sonne of God him ſelfe: for which cauſe, let not vs feare, but that the glorie which he wil giue vs ſhall ſo terrefie our enemies, as that they ſhall be made our foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoole, according to that ſaying of the ſcripture. Howbéet, Saint Paule, here namely ſetteth downe, who they are that muſt looke to be partakers of the glorie of the Sonne of God:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.</note> and hée decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the fruites of all thoſe that haue beléeued, in theſe wordes, <hi>Saintes.</hi> For hée ſheweth that they which are carried away with the pollutions &amp; corruptions of this worlde, muſt not looke to haue any parte or portion in this enheritance, nor yet be partakers of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing which belongeth vnto the Sonne of God.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe, in this ſaying, <hi>They which haue beleeued,</hi> hée ſheweth that fayth is the verie right ſpringhead and beginning of all holineſſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, hée ſheweth, that if our fayth be pure and right, that it is impoſſible but that we muſt eftſoones be ſanctified. Thus wée ſée thrée pointes which we are to obſerue. The firſt is, That if we foyle, and tumble our ſelues in our filthineſſe, and corruptions, we are quite cut off from the Sonne of God: and therefore let vs not looke to be any whit the better for his comming: but call to minde the ſaying of the Prophet, in theſe wordes, Deſire not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the day of the Lorde:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Amos.</hi> 5.</note> For it ſhall be a day of terrour and feare, and not of health and ioy.</p>
            <pb n="202" facs="tcp:7663:208"/>
            <p>For, by reaſon there were in thoſe dayes, a great number of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, who cloaked them ſelues with the name of God, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet telleth them that it will coſt them deare. After the ſame ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie maner ſhal we ſée the moſt wicked at this day, with ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mouth and wyde throate ſay, What I beſéech you good Syr? thinke you that we feare not God, and that wée will not be as good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as the reſt? Thus, no doubt of it, will they ſay: and yet in the meane while, a man ſhall ſée nothing in them but wantonnes, and all vngodlines, and as religious as Dogges and Swine. And examine their lyues, and we ſhall finde them altogether diſloyall, and faythleſſe like Foxes, full of treaſon, periurie, crueltie, and bitterneſſe vnto their neighbours: giuen to all kinde of harme and outrage, and full of all corruption, ſo that whoſoeuer giueth them moſt, they will be ſure to be no loſers: They will kéepe open ſhop to take of all handes, inſomuch that they will not onely ſell their fayth and credite, but their honour and honeſtie alſo euen in open ſight: and will kéepe open fayre and market to vtter all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. To be ſhort, they will ſhewe them ſelues extreame impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent contemptuous perſons, and yet forſooth, they will not ſticke to bragge, that they are the frowardeſt men in all the Church of God: and thinke, that God will helpe them, as if hée were greatly behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vnto them. And therefore, as we ſée it to be thus at this day, euen ſo the Prophet ſpeaking to thoſe that were in his dayes, ſaith, What? what kinde of bragges are theſe that you make, of the Lordes comming? Why? thinke you to receiue any benefite by his comming? No, no: But be aſſured that it will be a terrible, and a moſt fearefull day to you. And ſo, according to my firſt ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we haue to note out of this place of Saint Paule, that if wée would haue the comming of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt auaileable to vs, and doe vs good, and to be the Redéemer of our ſaluation, wée muſt learne to conſecrate our ſelues to holineſſe of life, and to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our ſelues from the corruptions of the worlde, and the fleſhe. And thus much for the firſt point. But to the attaining héereof, let vs note, that we muſt begin with fayth: according to that which we haue lately ſaid: For, to ſay truely, fayth,<note place="margin">Actes. 15.<hi>6.</hi>
               </note> is the ſpring head of all holineſſe, as it is ſaide in the Actes, where Saint Peter ſayeth, That God cleanſeth the heartes of men by fayth.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7663:209"/>
            <p>And this was ſpoken to this end and purpoſe, to ſhewe that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer glorious ſhewe we make, that we ſhall alwayes be corrupt and ſtinking before the Maieſtie of God, vntill ſuch time as God cleanſeth vs by the meane of fayth. As for the third point, we are admoniſhed, that if we haue a liuely fayth, it cannot be choſen but that we muſt eftſoones be ſanctified: to wit, that we cannot but be refourmed to the ſeruice of God, and be conſecrated to honor him. And howe is that? Forſooth, becauſe that wee embraſing Ieſus Chriſt by fayth, hée will dwell in vs, according to the ſaying of all the whole ſcripture: and namely, Saint Paule vſeth theſe words to the Epheſians, Ieſus Chriſt (ſaith hée) dwelleth in your hearts by fayth.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ephe.</hi> 3.17.</note> I beſéech you tell mée, doe not theſe thinges hang yll fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoredly together, That Ieſus Chriſt dwelleth in vs, and we in the meane while giue our ſelues to all villainy and filthineſſe? Do wée thinke that hée will dwell in a Swine ſtie? And therefore we muſt conſecrate our ſelues vnto him.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, hée cannot be with vs, but by his holie ſpirite. And is not this the ſpirite of holineſſe, righteouſneſſe, and cleanneſſe. Will not this be a ſtraunge medley, when as we will bragge to haue fayth in Ieſus Chriſt, and yet liue wantonly and wickedly, and be ſtayned with all the corruptions of the worlde? This is as a man would ſay, I holde the Sunne, and it ſhineth not: and as if a man would turne vpſide downe, the whole order of nature: For it is more like that the Sunne ſhould be without light, then that Ieſus Chriſt ſhould be without righteouſneſſe. And therefore, let vs make this obſeruation, that we take not this cloake of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie vpon vs, and ſay that we haue fayth in the Goſpell, and that we beleeue in good ſadneſſe, without our life and conuerſation be anſwerable, and ſhewe that we haue receiued Ieſus Chriſt, and that through the grace of his holie ſpirite, hée conſecrateth, &amp; ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth vs to the obedience of God his Father. We ſée then, that we muſt not come with fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> enſignes to vſurpe this name of faith, being a moſt holie thing. And therefore let vs take héede we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane it not: But if we beleeue in the Sonne of God, let vs effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſhewe, that we haue done ſo. And then no doubt, hée wil make vs féele his power, and giue vs grace, paciently to tarry his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. And although we muſt in this worlde, ſuffer many iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for his names ſake, yet ſhall we in the end be clothed with his
